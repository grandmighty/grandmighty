Anderson Paak&#039;s Album is called Malibu, I recommend checking it out, he was also on this years XXL Freshman Cypher 2016 with Lil Dicky and Desiigner, but he mostly does R&#038;B and soul, which surprised me that he made the list, but he is actually a dope rapper too, so it make sense.]]></description>

The NxWorries album? I gave it a listen and it&#039;s jazzy and smooth, quite a different style. I haven&#039;t heard of Anderson Paak before.]]></description>
