					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I followed your signature on Zilvia to here, and I must say, I&#039;m very impressed with your thoroughness with your vehicles, and the attention to detail. I absolutely love your FD, and I&#039;m sure the S13 will not fail to impress. I have some of the Voodoo arms on my car as well, and I love them. Can&#039;t wait to see what you do with the S13, man. Keep up the awesome work, and the great narrative.]]></description>
