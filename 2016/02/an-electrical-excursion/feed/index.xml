					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2016/02/an-electrical-excursion/#comment-199650&quot;&gt;4g63rotary&lt;/a&gt;.

Ouch! Sounds like you still have a few more nights bent over a soldering iron ahead :( Redoing wires is no joke... even with my 40 or so connections, it still took forever to do it cleanly. 

Airbags came into prominence right around the early 90s... which means its technology is relatively archaic and I rather not trust a &quot;safety&quot; feature that was early in its development. Airbag systems have of course come a LONG way now and are much more sophisticated with staged deployments, whereas back in the day it was essentially just a bomb, Lol. 

I think the fundamentals of building a car, like its body and chassis, were established many decades ago. Similarly, it looks like the naturally aspirated combustion engine has peaked in terms of development, it seems like companies are no longer able to meet EPA regulations and obtain desired outputs, which is why companies like Porsche are all turning to turbos and alternative power systems. The broken down, more techy features of a car, like gauges, electronics, ABS, Airbags, etc., are still in progress of maturation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having had to pull my entire front main and dash harnesses only to cut and clean and reinstall I can 100% sympathize with you here. You did a great job and have added another level of quality to your car. I still have to go back and solder some of the many loose wires. SMH!!! nice post man! 

On another note I&#039;m still struggling with pulling out the airbag system I feel like its one of those stock components that should stay in but its sooooo old I fear its completely worthless...]]></description>
