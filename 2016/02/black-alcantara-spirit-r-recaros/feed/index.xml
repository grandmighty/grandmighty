					<description><![CDATA[Hey All.

I am looking for Recaro Seat Belt Straps FD3S for these very same seats. Does anyone know where I can get these shoulder straps? A good friend of mine had his damaged and I&#039;m trying to find one for an early birthday gift.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2016/02/black-alcantara-spirit-r-recaros/#comment-230929&quot;&gt;Joshua&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the comment Joshua, sounds like you picked up a nice car and definitely for a great price. Wish we could get USDM FDs for that range. You&#039;re off to a good start for sure. If you already have a Mustang, maybe you could diversify your stable and keep the FD rotary? Especially if it&#039;s not going to be your every day driver. 

But if you still opt to take the V8 plunge, talk to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad I found this.  I picked up a 93 rx7 from Japan for $4.5k auction ($8k total shipped/fee&#039;s) with 72k miles.  I&#039;m currently living in Germany and will bring back the FD in 2018 (25 yrs old) to the USA.  Now my rx7 is nowhere the car you had when you started, but the car did come with Regamasters, which was a nice and some recaro A8&#039;s, which barely fit.  Car runs great with zero issues.  I started my parts collection with greddy dp, bazai oil pan brace, tune up kit, AEM wideband, I could go on and on, but there is so much to do with this car.  Definitely a money pit, but a sexy one.  You&#039;re an inspiration and I&#039;ve had Mustangs (4 total) and I&#039;m contemplating taking the V8 plunge.  My current daily is a 2013 procharged GT 5.0, so you can see my likes in cars.  Keep up the good work, Sir]]></description>
