					<description><![CDATA[Curious to know why you&#039;re planning on re-upholstering the seats.  I could&#039;ve swore you had them redone in the synthetic suede just a while back.  Given that limited amount of seat time you&#039;ve had in the car, has the material already worn off that bad?

Also, what&#039;s wrong with the front bumper?  I think you also went through a couple iterations on that guy.

Finally, what&#039;s wrong with the current rollbar?  Has it failed or something?  Very curious your rationale to these items on the to-do list.]]></description>
