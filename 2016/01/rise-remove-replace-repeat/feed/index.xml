					<description><![CDATA[Interesting seeing you go back to alcantara! 
I have an Type RZ with the, black, famous seats, and my driver side seat is badly damaged. i have been sending pictures to some local shops to have it fixed, but when viewing the images they aren&#039;t sure its actually alcantara... Are you sure it is? Im sure they will change their mind once they get to see the chair live.

I saw your previous post, and figured what i clever way of doing the reupholster using suede which is much cheaper. Now I&#039;m more hesitant to using it, also since my passenger side seat is still looking great.

What about adding some sort of extra layer to prevent wear when getting in/out of the car? Im thinking about it, will have a talk to the guys who gets to do my seat. Since its so darn expensive to replace the fabric, i don&#039;t want to have to do it again anytime soon.]]></description>

I been following your build for a long time and I always look forward to your updates. 
I just recently sold my FD and I regret not driving it as much as I could. I was always working on it instead of just driving the car and enjoying it. Hopefully you&#039;ll be &quot;finished&quot; when summer arrives!]]></description>

I feels you. I&#039;m making it a mission to get this car out this year and hopefully all the things I&#039;m working on currently meet a successful end. It&#039;s hard to believe that in the near 4 years I&#039;ve owned this RX-7, I&#039;ve never really had to the chance to properly drive it.]]></description>
