					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say it is on the oval side, close to a Shoei in my opinion, but you have to be careful of the shell sizes the X-Lites come in. I&#039;m used to a Small in other brands, which share the same shell size as Mediums... but a small on this X802 has its own, smaller shell size. This made the fit way too small for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What headshape do you think the X802 has? I&#039;m looking for a replacement to my Shark RSR2 (tight lid). Can&#039;t seem to find a lot about headshape but hopefully it&#039;ll be on the oval side.]]></description>
