You got a great deal on the suit!! I have the same size suit as you, too. I haven&#039;t noticed the bagginess in the lower back too much, mainly because I&#039;m usually focused on the tightness around the crotch when upright, LOL 

I think the W-Frame just has an aggressive race cut in it and is best suited leaned down in a riding position. I&#039;m kind of wishing I got it in All Black as the white seems to be a bit hard to maintain over time]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got the same suit in same colours, use it for every day riding with Sidi Vertigo boots, great bit of kit, only trouble I find is when standing with it on the lower back / bum area is a little baggy, when on bike its fine, the 2 peice I used to have I was snug as a bug in a rug but it was an older 1980s suite with only small armoursections and was getting very tatty hence replacement, compaired to the W-Frame which is well armourd, mine is a UK 40 -EU50 and other than the baggy back fits very well, got mine for £800 ($1200 ish) brand new with Dainese care pack, hanger and suite cover, a bargin, the Sidi boots are black with red and white detailing, one thing the suite should of had is a zip in the crotch area as taking a pee is a little troublesome without taking top half off, the T-age does !]]></description>
