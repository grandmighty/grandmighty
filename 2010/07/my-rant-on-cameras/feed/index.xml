					<description><![CDATA[yup, I would say it comes down to personal preference and what you&#039;re shooting. The only disadvantage of not being able to zoom... is having to move around. No biggie :) especially if what you shoot is normally static]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i kinda realized that you never did have any wide angle lenses and what not. and now that you admitted that you&#039;ve only rocked the 50mm, it definitely makes more sense now. but it is true, that&#039;s all you need. the &quot;human-eye&quot; point-of-view lens. if using a zoom lens, i&#039;d personally use it either all the way zoomed out, or zoomed all the way in. rarely do i ever go in between (if i do use a zoom lens). shoot, the only lens i have for my old Pentax K1000 is my 50mm f/2 lens. been meaning to at least get a fixed 28mm lens for my wide angle needs at times. other than that, i guess it&#039;s just personal preference in the end.]]></description>
