I think you should give it a go. I remember falling into this cataloging stuff almost 8 years ago, and it&#039;s stuck ever since. Then again, I&#039;ve always had a penchant for keeping up a website for the sake of it, so that helped spur things into this direction. Being able to put into words and keep track of your project at the end of the day adds another dimension. Either way, it&#039;s at least memorable to read back on if anything. 

That&#039;s a pretty handy use of the opened oil cooler spot. I must say it&#039;s convenient that these engines do not require an oil cooler. I won&#039;t be road racing either so I won&#039;t be adding one in to maintain simplicity.]]></description>

Hey Eric,
Unfortunately at the moment I don&#039;t have anything documented. Nothing online anyway. Just a pile of receipts. 
I will likely compile it all into a file on my computer pictures, parts list etc. Which I&#039;ll be more than happy to share.

While I enjoy creative build threads with thoughtful writing immensely, I don&#039;t believe I could put an effective one together myself. I feel I would miss a lot of small things. But who knows, first time for everything right?

As for the battery, yep that&#039;s exactly where I relocated it. Initially I didn&#039;t like the location as it was a hassle removing the bumper to jump/charge it or disconnect in the winter (about a 2-month downtime in Kelowna B.C. Canada). Since placing it there though, I&#039;ve added a disconnect switch and jumper pole underneath the front rad support that are easily accessible.

Thanks Josh! I&#039;m looking forward to it for sure. Do you have a link to more information on your car&#039;s swap? 

I was looking at your engine bay picture in your comment from my previous post. It looks like you were able to mount your battery in the passenger side oil cooler location? Very interesting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome!
Haha, just as I ask in my last comment you go and post this.
You&#039;re going to love the TR6060. I used the T56 Magnum which is essentially the same. Has the updated shift forks. 
Makes for honestly the shortest manual transmission shifts I&#039;ve ever felt in person. Rifle fast.

enjoy!
