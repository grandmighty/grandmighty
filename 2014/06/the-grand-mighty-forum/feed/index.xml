No such thing as taking up valuable site space! The important part is getting it started, the pace doesn&#039;t matter as much :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well sad to see 7tuned go, with that said a Grand Mighty forum should have been where you started in the first place. Brings in a wider group of enthusiast and allowing you to not have to focus on building it as much. Not to mention your wide variety of hobbies and interests can be discussed here allowing it to be a more diverse forum. I saw the site man its super clean and like you said as straight forward as you can get! I&#039;m of the learning type myself so I usually hold off on posting because I know there are those that are much more seasoned at teaching and sharing than I. With that said I like posting and getting into the convo when I can. I even like doing the build thread thing but my builds always take FOREVER so I hate to take up valuable site space with my dribble lol.

That&#039;s strange, I&#039;ve turned off the requirement for email validation in the time being. I also set your account into the Members group, could you try logging in again? If it still doesn&#039;t work, let me know here and I can delete your account so you can re-register without needing the validation.]]></description>

Glad you saw this, I actually made this forum with you in mind, haha. From our previous comments, I kept thinking to myself, &quot;Hmm, I wonder if there&#039;s an easier way to allow Josh to share his build...&quot;]]></description>
