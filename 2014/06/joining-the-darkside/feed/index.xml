BUAHAHA!!! The purist nerdrage in you is hilarious. Stay mad, boy, I&#039;ll do what I want. I was beginning to wonder when I&#039;d start getting some heat about the swap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You completely fucktarded this amazing 94 FD3S. In all honesty, you should have never even touched one. &quot;Hey man, I got an idea, since I never drive the best car ever made, I&#039;ll completely ruin it by swapping in a V8, MURICA!!!&quot; 

GOH, I hope you lose this FD, it  then falls into the hands of a real owner and swapped back to the REW. In fact, shut down this blog. It&#039;s a waste of key strokes. 

Get a corvette or mustang you ape, can do burnouts and hoon all you want, leave the RX7 to true dedicated owners.]]></description>

Hi Eric,
For the most part, the stock fuse boxes are hidden under the drivers side pop up bucket. Where an R1 would have had its oil cooler. Since the V8 doesn&#039;t require an oil cooler (I suppose if I was taking it to the track it would) There was ample room under there. The ones I may need access to are almost directly behind that light bucket in the bay, kind of hard to see in the picture. 
The fuse box for the LS engine harness I hid up under the glove box. It was a really tight fit and I had to make a removable panel in the backside of my glove box in order to access the fuses if needed. Really hesitated doing this as I wanted to keep all my interior panels intact, but I figure I only keep my papers and phone in there when connected to the radio, so it was a necessary evil in order to keep the bay clean in my scenario. 

Hopefully soon I can move on to exterior stuff! 

Any thoughts as to which LS or transmission you&#039;ll be going with yet?

take care,

josh]]></description>

I know my decision with the swap will displease a few people, but in my book, horsepower is horsepower... and I love V8s!!

Thanks for the compliments and support. I have a few for sale threads up on RX7Club already, but I will need to let go of things like the Full-Race manifold and my entire A-Spec Single Turbo kit, if you know anyone that&#039;s interested :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dang it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well got that off my chest hahaha... pleased to see you writing again! And yeah I&#039;m not a fan of the V8 swap (don&#039;t get me wrong I love V8&#039;s ) but I am glad its an option to keep our little money pits on the road! Despite your new plan of action I intend to watch this build closely not for the end result but for the excellent read you provide! 
I hope to buy some of those parts you&#039;re bound to sell on the forums and I anticipate a first class build out of this future LS of yours! I&#039;m not sure if you know it or not but the stress behind your builds is self inflicted hahaha but that stress seems to bring out the finer side of your detailed oriented personality! Keep up the good work!]]></description>

Hey Josh, that&#039;s awesome! Looks like you&#039;ve done a very clean swap on your car. It&#039;s amazing how clean the engine is with the tuck. What did you end doing with the stock chassis wiring and fuse boxes? Thanks and I hope to be joining you with the swap soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad to see you back in the game. 
I&#039;ve been following this blog for years, quite admire your writing style and detailed progress pics.

I myself am just nearing the end of my V8 swap in my 93 FD. Used all Samberg components as well. Went new LS3 the 376/480
Almost the same reasons fuelled my swap as I had a GT35R single before. Wanted to be able to do long haul road trips, I knew the reliability of the rotary limited that. 

Good luck with the swap, I look forward to your progress. If you have any questions I can help with feel free to email away!
