It was less than what I wanted primarily because I had to part with the RegaMasters and Spirit R seats... but it was fair enough to make me decide it was right to cut ties early, and just let it go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With all the unwarranted hate online you received for your asking price I hope you made out well! I won&#039;t be as rude to ask what you got for it, but may I ask was it enough to make you feel satisfied?]]></description>

Thanks Ronnie. I may be at the &quot;finish&quot; line with this car, but hopefully there are a few more tricks up my sleeve. The bigger question is if I will continue to have the time to invest in updating this website, or if I will have to step back into a quicker medium. 

As far as going crazy with the FD chassis, I think I&#039;ve done my part. It&#039;s time for someone else to take the reigns and the torch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who follows this site, it&#039;s very bittersweet to see the car coming to &quot;completion.&quot; I use quotes there, because no car is every truly &quot;complete,&quot; but you already know that. I say it&#039;s bittersweet, because it&#039;s awesome to see the final product really coming to shape, and getting to see the vision you have realized. The bitterness comes in knowing that the updates will be fewer and farther apart, and they won&#039;t be of building. Maybe I should drop subliminal hints for you to grab a spare chassis, and go crazy on. My buddy has a rolling chassis for sale, for a great price, and your car has me thinking hard about whether I can afford a second project right now, haha.]]></description>
