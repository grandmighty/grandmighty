Thanks Wendell, I appreciate you following along all these years and your support. And the addiction is real, I already have something up my sleeves. Although at a much smaller and pulled back scale...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oddly enough I was asking myself when this was going to happen...Sad part is knowing that it was slightly inevitable I was still shocked when I read the headline. Good thing is you&#039;re kind of a drug addict when it comes to cars so I know that I&#039;ll be able to come back to this site or any blog with your name on it and find something interesting to read! Even if it isn&#039;t car related you tell great stories :) so they&#039;ll be something to look forward to.

Adulting does have its drawbacks but we do it with hopes of some kind of reward for our selves and the ones we care about! So rock on dude, I commend you for your extreme efforts of quality and refined finishing!
