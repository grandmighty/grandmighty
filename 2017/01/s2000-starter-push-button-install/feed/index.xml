					<description><![CDATA[I am not so versed and I think I m having the same problem tiubhave with the relay clicking when pressing the start button. You said to swap pin 30 &#038; 87a but I used a 4-pin relay. Also I have a 1996 Honda Civic and the colors you said aren’t matching up. I need help connecting this push start. I purchased a harness to save me all this troubles but I am still stuck .]]></description>
