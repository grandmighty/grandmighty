All of my correspondence with Paul has been with the same sales@plastics4performance address. There was a period when he went dark during my ordering process as well. But yeah, try giving them a call. 

I also fixed the contact form.]]></description>

Thanks for the reply Eric. Yeah I haven&#039;t even placed the order yet, was going over details with Paul before the holidays and got too busy. I&#039;ll try giving them a call. Let me know if you come across any reliable email. Thanks!
I&#039;ve listed my email if you want to reply directly.]]></description>

Hi Chris,

There was some time during my ordering process where the communication with Paul had delays, but he eventually gets back to you. I&#039;m guessing the window is still being worked on because they actually ship them out to Norway for coating before doing the final trimmings. 

I was able to call them at their listed UK number. I called early in the morning PST and caught them on the phone and they were receptive. 

I&#039;ll check out the contact form and see what&#039;s going on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Eric. Was doing a little recon online and came across your Plastics4Performance install blog. I was wondering if you would be able to share your contact at P4P with me. I was talking with a guy named Paul over there many months ago about windows for my FD time attack project, but now that some time has gone by he is no longer replying to my emails. The address he was using was just sales@plastics4performance. Do you happen to have a better contact? Thanks Eric, I appreciate any help/info. 
Btw - I attempted to send this via your &quot;contact&quot; applet but it appears to be bugged.]]></description>
