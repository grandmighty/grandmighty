					<description><![CDATA[Interested in printing my own decals for my 18&quot;-ers too.  Would you be willing to share your art? Would like the decals you showed and if you have a hi-res scan of your center caps so I can make center cap stickers (can&#039;t afford real caps so I&#039;ll make my own).   Nice job and Thanks!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love your car, and great choice of wheels! I actually just picked up a set of 18x9.5 +18 Marquis Promadas off Yahoo Auctions myself, but they didn&#039;t come with center caps... Would you be at all willing to part with 4 of yours? :)]]></description>

If it&#039;s oxidized in between the caps, there&#039;s not a whole lot you can do. I just polished my caps to make minor swirls and scratches better.]]></description>
