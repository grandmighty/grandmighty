The stock Mazda threading is a finer M10x1.25. The different lever threading meant I had to ditch the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/08\/cast-your-vote\/\">FEED shift knob<\/a>, unfortunately. On the bright side, this enabled me to try a new direction and go with a product that wasn&#8217;t quite off the shelf&#8230; I\u00a0looked around at various custom alternatives from companies and ended up shooting an email to Chris at WC Lathe Werks to see what he could do for me.<\/p>\n<p>After a few back and forth exchanges, I was able to finalize the exact shift knob that I visualized with him:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2&#8243; diameter sphere<\/li>\n<li>2.75&#8243;x1.2&#8243; collar<\/li>\n<li>Blended transition<\/li>\n<li>2 grip grooves<\/li>\n<li>Titanium<\/li>\n<li>Blue\/Bronze coloring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/shiftknob.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5317\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/shiftknob.jpg\" alt=\"shiftknob\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I have always liked spherical shift knobs. With this being a hand made affair, I wanted to take the opportunity to elevate the design aspects. I decided on adding a taller collar to the shift knob to increase leverage and reachability. The quality and machine work on this shift knob is very high. I can&#8217;t wait to throw it on and start rowing through gears. I would personally rank a shift knob equal to a steering wheel in terms of &#8220;touch factor&#8221; and driver input importance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While work is continued on the car, here is a mid-week update to tide things over.
