All of the supplies were bought well in advance. If you&#8217;re thinking about epoxying your garage as well, word of advice &#8211; this is not a walk-in-the-park sort of deal. It&#8217;s easy to think that rolling on some paint would be painless, but the whole task is very laborious. Take a look at all the supplies that were needed, and I still needed to go back for more rollers, etc. I went with the Rustoleum Epoxy kit in a specially tinted color along with the Premium Clear Coat kit.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/rustoleumepoxy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3630\" title=\"rustoleumepoxy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/rustoleumepoxy-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/rustoleumepoxy-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/rustoleumepoxy-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/rustoleumepoxy.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Everything amounted to a sum in excess of $500. And that didn&#8217;t even include the 3200psi pressure washer that was needed to clean the floor&#8230; which I was fortunately able to borrow. At first I guffawed at Home Depot&#8217;s price of ~$1500 to have a professional take care of everything, but now it makes more sense.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/supplies.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3631\" title=\"supplies\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/supplies-620x829.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"829\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/supplies-620x829.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/supplies.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Speaking of cleaning, that was the most labor intensive part and also the most important. Many hours (I&#8217;d estimate 10-11 hours total from the prepping to the actual painting) of rinsing, degreasing, scrubbing, power washing, concrete etching, and sealing cracks &amp; dents were required.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/powerwashing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3634\" title=\"powerwashing\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/powerwashing-620x463.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"463\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/powerwashing-620x463.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/powerwashing-800x597.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/powerwashing.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s awesome to have a 3-car garage now, but it&#8217;s not awesome to have to paint it. I bought 2 kits of the base coat, enough for a rated 3.5 car garage. For the clear coat, I bought 2 kits enough for a 4-car garage. Since I had to use separate kits, it was important to pre-mix everything from the base coat into a bucket, and then pour the contents back in accordingly. This ensures that the color shade will match when you eventually switch over to the next kit.<\/p>\n<p>For the actual painting, I first trimmed and cut-in at the edges with a 3&#8243; brush. I had to work diligently because the paint has a pot life before it cures. The worst part of the painting was how strong the fumes were. I had to paint with the garage doors mostly closed because it happened to be a super windy day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/garageepoxy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3635\" title=\"garageepoxy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/garageepoxy-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/garageepoxy-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/garageepoxy-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/garageepoxy.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I liked the way the color and tint came out.

I focused too much on finding a roller in the right nap size (1\/2&#8243; for the base, 3\/8&#8243; for the clear), and not enough on looking for something that was synthetic with short fibers. This hindsight caused little bumps to be everywhere in the paint. I was mad because it spoiled all the hard work, but quickly got over it when I realized that this was the garage after all, and the floor will be abused sooner or later. Hopefully the epoxy can actually hold up to said abuse and not flake off.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, I&#8217;m still glad I took the time to epoxy the floor, but it&#8217;s definitely not something I&#8217;d do again. Tiles probably would have been easier.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the RX-7 conveniently dropped off at the body shop, I was able to focus on moving in.
