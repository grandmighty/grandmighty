The gloves themselves weren&#8217;t bad, but at the same time they didn&#8217;t strike me as being anything stellar. I think that&#8217;s fairly representative for Alpinestars as a brand &#8211; &#8220;good&#8221; products, but not at the top.<\/p>\n<p>I was originally looking at a pair of Dainese Full Metal gloves, and was close to pulling the trigger on them, until by serendipity I discovered the Knox Handroid gloves. Knox, known to make stellar back protectors, recently came out with this very stunning glove, or &#8220;hand armor&#8221; as they call it. After merely looking at them, I knew these were the gloves to get. The price, surprisingly, wasn&#8217;t bad either. The Handroids&#8217; retail isn&#8217;t much higher than what the GP-Pros go for&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The Handroids came in today, and quality and sheer level of detail was immediately apparent. As I said, the GP-Pro&#8217;s were good gloves, but these Knoxes are on a completely different level. The amount of technology in these gloves alone sets them apart.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxhandroid.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-928\" title=\"knoxhandroid\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxhandroid-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxhandroid-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxhandroid.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The underside has Kangaroo leather, which is more abrasion and tear resistant than conventional leather, and can be utilized thinner.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/kangarooleather.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-926\" title=\"kangarooleather\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/kangarooleather-540x720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/kangarooleather-540x720.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/kangarooleather.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A look at the sliders and cuff area.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxslp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-927\" title=\"knoxslp\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxslp-540x720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxslp-540x720.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/knoxslp.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Arguably, the feature that stands out the most are the Exo Skeletal spines, which cover vulnerable areas of the fingers.
