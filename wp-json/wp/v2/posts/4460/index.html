Back when I was trying to sell my <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/09\/work-xd9s-ride-height-adjustment\/\">XD-9&#8217;s<\/a>, I was in communication with another member on RX7Club who was interested in trading me a rear brake kit. The brakes ended up not being the exact ones I wanted, but during the process I discovered that he had a new <a href=\"http:\/\/definedautoworks.com\">Defined Autoworks<\/a> V-Mount kit laying around. I think he went with an LSx swap and no longer needed it, so I bought it. <\/p>\n<p>The kit was missing all of the small hardwares and radiator hoses. I had to piece them together myself through Defined and McMaster-Carr. In the end, it was still worth the effort and risk because I didn&#8217;t have to wait for the whole kit to be made. <\/p>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised with the design and fitment of the V-Mount, which made the installation uneventful, for the most part. Of course there were a few minor things I had to modify, like dropping the oil coolers&#8217; hardlines to clear the radiator and trimming down the aluminum ducts. <\/p>\n<p>Here is the Koyo radiator mounted, which is now positioned at a transverse angle in comparison to stock. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/koyoradiator.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/koyoradiator-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"koyoradiator\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4462\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/koyoradiator-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/koyoradiator-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/koyoradiator.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With this setup, I was forced to switch to a slimmer 14&#8243; single fan. The stock dual fans were far too thick, and I probably would have had to run new oil cooler lines to fit them, as well as extend an outlet on the radiator to clear. Furthermore, the fans now sit on the bottom of the radiator, facing the ground. A thick fan would impede height clearance. The single fan is currently mounted with push-through zip ties, but I plan on looking into a hard mount solution in the future. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/radiatorfan.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/radiatorfan-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"radiatorfan\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4463\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/radiatorfan-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/radiatorfan-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/radiatorfan.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Once the radiator was situated, the intercooler then goes on.
