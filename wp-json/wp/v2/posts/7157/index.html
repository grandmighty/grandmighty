I sometimes feel like a luddite in terms of my musical tastes because I more often than not prefer old over new. I&#8217;ve probably reiterated this ad nausea, but most of the current offerings sound either too pop, are too shallow, and\/or have poor lyricism. <\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why it feels like I&#8217;ve been waiting almost an eternity for a new, good album to drop. Starboy has high consistency throughout the tracks in quality and is far better than The Weeknd&#8217;s previous album, &#8220;Behind the Beauty and Madness,&#8221; which strayed with abandonment into the mainstream pop realm.
