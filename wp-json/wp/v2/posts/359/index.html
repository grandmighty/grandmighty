It&#8217;s a salvaged titled bike with fairing damage, which is a good candidate for a track bike. However, rarely do things of this nature unfold without other peculiarities. The bike turned out to have a gross misalignment with the front wheel. With the handlebars straight, the wheels were skewed a few inches off center. As far as I could tell, it might have just been damage to the triple clamp and bars&#8230; Then, when the guy brought out the pink slip, I found out the miles on it was higher than on the odometer. The cluster was changed out since the whole front of the bike slid into a pole. I decided that was too much and the bike was too rough for me, so I didn&#8217;t buy it. Hopefully I can find something that requires less work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I rolled with a buddy over to Coyote Point in San Mateo for some car event called &#8220;Hella Flush&#8221; 5 or 6 or whatever it&#8217;s at now.
