However, the process of removing the old tubing, fitting in the PowerBraid, and redoing all the joints was definitely NOT painless.\u00a0The task was so tedious it took me more than 4 hours to complete. Was it worth it? I&#8217;m not sure, but I don&#8217;t want to do it again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/painless.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5218\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/painless.jpg\" alt=\"painless\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Complimenting the in-tank Bosch 044 assembly from <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2014\/06\/lsx-parts-overview-iv\/\">Overview IV<\/a>, I have a Hyperion surge tank cover. In the RX-7&#8217;s fuel tank, there is a small, plastic &#8220;tank&#8221;\u00a0that the fuel pump hangs over. The downside is this tank is 4 walls with no top. Being uncovered allows fuel to slosh over during higher G turns and creates a starvation issue. The Hyperion cover will help contain the fuel inside the tank and minimize spillage.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/hyperion.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5216\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/hyperion.jpg\" alt=\"hyperion\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For the shifter, I will be ditching the stock Camaro unit in favor of this MGW short shifter.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/mgwshifter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5217\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/mgwshifter.jpg\" alt=\"mgwshifter\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This is the epitome of fine machine work, almost all of it is from billet aluminum.
