In actuality, I had everything I needed and was ready to start on the work for quite some time now. Instead, and to be perfectly frank, I was content with letting the parts sit on my shelves while I enjoyed the downtime. As you may be aware from looking back a few posts, I haven&#8217;t been the most active lately. <\/p>\n<p>In fact, I don&#8217;t think I even drove the car in all this time &#8211; aside from the occasional warm-ups. I pushed all car related matters and thoughts outside my cognition and perception, and let me tell you, it felt great&#8230; The single turbo project over the Winter was an intense affair and its comedown left me in a state of weariness. Tackling car projects with a high level of scrutiny truly requires immense motivation and dedication. It will test the stamina of anyone. <\/p>\n<p>Alas, I found an impetus to end my &#8220;vacation&#8221; and carry on. Before diving into the actual installation, I need to start with a preface on the big brake kit. The RX-7&#8217;s brake system is generally very good and capable. However, this fact still doesn&#8217;t exclude it from being upgraded. My overall agenda with my car is to raise its standards holistically, while still operating within in the scope of Mazda&#8217;s original concept. As an analogy, I&#8217;m pursuing my goals in the same vein as Porsche did with their GTx RS cars. <\/p>\n<p>With that said, I narrowed my decision for a big brake kit upgrade to the Brembo GT. Buying this kit new is prohibitively expensive, but I was lucky in being able to find a low-mileage set of calipers and rotor hats. To finish the puzzle and take care of the friction discs, I bought a pair of cross-drilled StopTech AeroRotors. The choice on going with cross-drilled over slotted was simply due to ballerness. It&#8217;s safe to assume that I will not be road racing this car in the near future, so the functional benefits of slotted versus cross-drilled are extraneous for me. In the similar mentality, I chose to go with StopTech Street pads all around for their balance of performance and low dust.<\/p>\n<p>In order to mount the StopTech AeroRotors to the Brembo hats, there was a catch. The 2 companies use a different method to &#8220;float&#8221; their rotors and also use different hardware. Brembo accomplishes this by having a small, raised step that circumferences the backside of the hat. StopTech, on the other hand, accomplishes the task through the hardware and does not need the raised lip. So I brought the hats down to a local machine shop and paid the owner on the side to carefully lathe it off.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the stock front brakes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stockfrontbrakes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stockfrontbrakes-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"stockfrontbrakes\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4759\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stockfrontbrakes-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stockfrontbrakes-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stockfrontbrakes.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Aside from the new Brembo brakes being obviously bigger in diameter, they are wider and have curved vanes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rotorcomparison.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rotorcomparison-777x587.jpg\" alt=\"rotorcomparison\" width=\"777\" height=\"587\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4758\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rotorcomparison-777x587.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rotorcomparison-960x725.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rotorcomparison.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cleaned, torqued down, and installed. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/brembogt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/brembogt-777x535.jpg\" alt=\"brembogt\" width=\"777\" height=\"535\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4755\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/brembogt-777x535.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/brembogt-960x661.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/brembogt.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The fitment compatibility with the front wheels was something I eagerly anticipated in testing.

I bought new lines, pads, rotors, and even remanufactured calipers. The last time ended up being a horrible decision. This is a classic example of doing too much, when you should just keep it simple. My original calipers were in great shape and needed no attention, yet I felt impelled to replace them, which is why reman calipers seemed like a good idea &#8211; since a professional company rebuilds and cleans them for you. Long story short, one of the calipers came with a piston that had pitting all over from past rust. Although this may have been functional and leak-free, I refused to install it on my car. <\/p>\n<p>I lied about the story&#8217;s brevity, allow me to expand. I called <a href=\"http:\/\/rockauto.com\">RockAuto.com<\/a> (I was referred to them by another RX7Club member without realizing it was some hodgepodge discount place) where I purchased these reman calipers from and requested a replacement or a refund. The customer service representative obliged, but noted that I would need to pay the shipping for a replacement. I didn&#8217;t feel like this was entirely fair because there was blatant product quality control and conformity issues. I was about to agree to their terms when it was suggested that a &#8220;manager&#8221; may be able to provide a better solution. After getting transferred to this so-called manager, he single-mindedly to deny my request altogether and dictates that no replacement will be granted. I of course questioned his state of mind and he proceeds to brag about his past &#8220;lead technician&#8221; credentials. So now I&#8217;m stuck with these calipers because this guru mechanic (probably only pumped gas for people) turned big boss manager of a call-center wanted to play tyrant. <\/p>\n<p>DO NOT BUY FROM ROCKAUTO&#8230; unless you want to receive garbage parts and then receive false promises. <\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, I opted to reuse my original rear calipers. I did have to put in grunt work to clean them up, strip the old paint, and then repaint them red to match the fronts.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/redcalipers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/redcalipers.jpg\" alt=\"redcalipers\" width=\"777\" height=\"1166\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4757\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rearbrakes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rearbrakes-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"rearbrakes\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4756\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rearbrakes-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rearbrakes-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/rearbrakes.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I know red brake calipers may seem cliche, but at the end of the day, they look damn good. Red on Black strikes an interesting contrast. On a related note, Black, Red, and White are colors that grab attention when used in combination (refer to Nazi flag&#8230;).<\/p>\n<p>I never seem to have much fortune when it comes to bleeding brakes, in one way or another, it always turns into an excruciating experience. During the first day, I ran out of a liter of ATE SuperBlue fluid. The next morning, a Sunday, I had to track down a store that was open and also carried ATE. I went over a couple cities to a Monument Car Parts store and was luckily able to buy it off their shelves (I&#8217;ve never even heard of Monument Car Parts prior to this). Then I proceeded to bleed the brakes for <strong>3 HOURS<\/strong> because I was adamant on getting EVERY little bubble out and made 3 rounds around the car. Why did it take 3 hours? Because TWICE I made the mistake of letting the reservoir run out of fluid, thus sucking in air and forcing me to repeat the process anew. I guess it&#8217;s difficult to control everything when you&#8217;re so focused on seeing little bubbles come out&#8230; pump after pump. It also didn&#8217;t help that the Brembo calipers had 2 bleed valves each. <\/p>\n<p>Best of all, I&#8217;ll have to rebleed the brakes AGAIN in the near future. I also deleted my ABS and wasn&#8217;t happy with a few bends in the new lines, so they will need replacing. I will save this topic for a post of its own, later. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the background, I was busy accumulating parts and performing the necessary tasks for a brake system overhaul.
