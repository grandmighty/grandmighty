And by old, I mean only 1-week old. Why so\u00a0fastidious, you may ask&#8230; Mainly because I wanted to take my riding more seriously, and that called for more serious gear. Just to note, the previous stuff included a Shoei RF-1100 helmet, Alpinestars S-MX 2 boots, Alpinestars GMX gloves, and a RS-Taichi RSJ826 jacket. The Shoei fit me perfectly in the beginning, but only after a week the padding broke in so much that the helmet felt loose. So I sold that. There wasn&#8217;t much wrong with the boots, but they were &#8220;short&#8221; boots and I didn&#8217;t really see a purpose for them. I was actually able to return them to the store. Similar story goes for the gloves, they were short gloves rather than full gauntlets. So far I&#8217;m still stuck with the RS-Taichi jacket, but I might just keep it for casual riding, we&#8217;ll see&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>When I \u00a0got back home from Dallas yesterday, I was greeted with a few packages in the garage. My new helmet and gloves were in there. Unfortunately, I caught the cold or flu the night before and couldn&#8217;t do much more than unbox and try on the gear. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and feeling a familiar soreness in the throat&#8230; that&#8217;s when I knew I was going to be in some sh*t the next few days. I am grateful that I didn&#8217;t get sick in the middle of the week during work. Aside from my throat feeling like it was on fire and feeling fatigued\/feverish most of today, I currently feel better&#8230; I bought some Cold-Eeze as soon as I felt sick, so maybe it did something.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, enough of that crap, back to the gear. I got an AGV GP-Tech in the Rossi 5-Continents scheme. I&#8217;m very pleased with the helmet, those Italians really know how to make stuff. The inner lining even has some ornamental embroidery. I also picked up a tinted Iridium Blue shield to go with it, you can&#8217;t really see the Blue\/Purple hue in these pictures though. <a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-116\" title=\"agvgptech\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-117\" title=\"agvgptech2\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech2-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech2-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech2.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>6 Exhaust vents in the rear that account for this helmet&#8217;s great flowing characteristics.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-118\" title=\"agvgptech3\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech3-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech3-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/agvgptech3.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One thing I didn&#8217;t like was the fact that the shield mechanism needed adjusting. For such an expensive helmet, you&#8217;d think everything would be handled from the factory. With the shield down, one side had more of a gap than the other. It took some tinkering with the screws holding down the plates to even things the sides and flush out the gaps.<\/p>\n<p>Next, I decided to go with the Alpinestars GP-Pro gloves. There&#8217;s a funny back story to this, I almost bought these gloves from someone off craigslist for $100 off retail&#8230; not to be stereotypical, but the guy had a fobby accent and suspiciously had a batch of these gloves from some &#8220;dealer&#8221; friend of his. When we met up, they were undoubtedly fake. People are copying everything these days.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-119\" title=\"alpinestarsgppro\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-120\" title=\"alpinestarsgppro2\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro2-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro2-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/alpinestarsgppro2.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still waiting on some boots, but I will post the suit together with it later.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As part of a birthday present to my self, so to speak, I decided to upgrade my old riding gear.
