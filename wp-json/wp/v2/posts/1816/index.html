At that moment, I noticed a small pool of fluid around the front right caliper&#8217;s banjo bolt. This particular connection had given me trouble in the past, and my method of torquing it to GUTENTIGHT apparently didn&#8217;t work. Although the leak was very slight, and who knows what really caused it, I made up my mind on what to do. And that&#8217;s when things got expensive, rather quickly.<\/p>\n<p>The brakes on this bike have been a nightmare. There&#8217;s always <em>something<\/em>. I changed the lines, the calipers, the master cylinder, and the master cylinder&#8217;s double banjo. Over time, I ended up bleeding over a liter and a half of fluid through it. Figured if I went this far, I might as well give it one more push. So instead of just changing the right caliper&#8217;s crush washers, I decided to redo all remaining banjo bolts with titanium ones. This meant draining the system and having to a full bleed job. I also took the opportunity to step up the brake fluid as well, more on that in a bit.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the new titanium banjo bolts. 3 are pictured, but I actually had to buy 4. I accounted for the front 2 calipers and the rear caliper, but forgot about the rear master cylinder&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/titaniumbanjobolts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1822\" title=\"titaniumbanjobolts\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/titaniumbanjobolts-600x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/titaniumbanjobolts-600x375.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/titaniumbanjobolts.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One of them installed:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/tibanjo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1821\" title=\"tibanjo\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/tibanjo-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/tibanjo-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/tibanjo.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My homemade reservoir, made out of tygon tubing and a brass plug, worked well in the rear.
