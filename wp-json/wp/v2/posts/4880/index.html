Following the same mindset in regards to switching the Rega Masters out in favor of the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2013\/08\/advan-rs-rz-with-toyo-r888\/\">Advans<\/a>, I decided the exhaust could benefit from added zest. While the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/09\/feed-sonic-ti-r\/\">FEED Sonic<\/a> was supremely light and sounded perfect, I felt that it was overall too sedate. The 3.5&#8243; tip blended in well and did not grab attention. The exhaust which I initially obtained via desperate and effortful coercion has grown to be boring for me.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m going to do all this work to modify the RX-7, I may as well embrace it outwardly. Fear not, I will never stray away from or bastardize the stock lines and body of the car&#8230; but there are a few choice areas that could be made more interesting. <\/p>\n<p>A catalyst emerged when I heard news that the Buddy Club Spec-II cat-back was finally being shipped Stateside. I&#8217;ve always had my eye on this particular exhaust, but it is hard to come by for the FD platform. After patiently waiting for <strong>1 year and 1 month<\/strong>, a phone call with Buddy Club USA finally gave me word that a shipment was inbound. I called to check every couple of months, primarily out of curiosity, so it was quite exciting to hear solid confirmation. <\/p>\n<p>However&#8230; the wait was not a fruitful one. After receiving the exhaust, I immediately noticed that all the welds were sloppily done with a Mig welder and the Buddy Club plaque on the tip was omitted. The resonator wasn&#8217;t even welded on straight. This was a far cry from the high quality construction and robotic Tig welds standard of Buddy Club exhausts (apparently not anymore). It&#8217;s a shame the company was willing to pass such a product into the market. <\/p>\n<p>After returning the Buddy Club, I began searching for other avenues. Since I avoid fart-can exhausts like the plague, the choices available for the RX-7 become rather limited. I eventually opted to go with a Rein Hard Dual #02 cat-back in Semi-Titanium. This had to be ordered with them in Japan and the exhausts are made to order. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhardsemiti.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhardsemiti-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"reinhardsemiti\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4885\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhardsemiti-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhardsemiti-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhardsemiti.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/stainless.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/stainless-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"stainless\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4886\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/stainless-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/stainless-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/stainless.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Rein Hards are not cheap, but at least the quality is ensured. The Dual #02 is similar to the Spec-II, except it has slash-cut, staggered dual tips. This exhaust is also void of any resonator for the FD&#8230; we&#8217;ll have to see how that goes. The tips come with a baffles and silencers, right and left respectively in the picture below. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhard002.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhard002-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"reinhard002\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4884\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhard002-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhard002-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/reinhard002.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I took the silencers out but left the baffles in.
