My pants would surely catch on fire some day if this was left alone, so I bought some titanium colored heat wrap and taped it up.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/exhaustwrap.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-747\" title=\"exhaustwrap\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/exhaustwrap-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/exhaustwrap-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/exhaustwrap.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sometime around here I drained the oil and poured in fresh Amsoil 20w-50. I also flushed the radiator, only to find out that the bike&#8217;s coolant was previously changed with Engine Ice. That made it a bit easier for me, I got a jug of Engine Ice and filled it back up.<\/p>\n<p>I had noticed that the stock Regina chain was very dry looking, probably from sitting for a while. The easy way would have been to simply clean the chain and lube it up. I decided to cut it off and install a new chain all together. After installing the DID 520 ERV3 chain on my CBR, I really liked its quality and decided to buy it again for the Husky.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m actually glad I shelled out for a chain tool kit now. Here is the new chain installed, not tensioned yet of course.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/diderv3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-746\" title=\"diderv3\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/diderv3-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/diderv3-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/diderv3.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One thing I disliked was how cluttered the handlebar was. The stock bar was a 7\/8&#8243;, I decided to upgrade to a fatter 1 1\/8&#8243; clamp ProTaper bar with Scott&#8217;s Steering Bar Mounts. I ended up having to buy 2 of the same ProTaper bars, because the first one was supposed supposed to be silver-ish but turned out to be blue hued. After I put on the new throttle side Renthal grip, and removed the stock bar, work was unfortunately\u00a0halted in that area. I had bought a Yamaha FZ1 clutch perch, and an AGV C5 shorty clutch lever for it. The lever was supposed to go on next along with the ProTaper bar, but as I was about to put the clutch cable into the lever, I realized that the cable&#8217;s anchor\/head thing was too big.<\/p>\n<p>I called Barnett Clutches and had them make me a new clutch cable with a different head to fit in my lever.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward a few days and I eventually got the whole controls area situated.<\/p>\n<p>Nice and tidy now.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/protaper.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-744\" title=\"protaper\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/protaper-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/protaper-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/protaper.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/agvshortyc5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"agvshortyc5\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/agvshortyc5-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I did order a brake lever with the clutch, but unfortunately that part had to be manufactured. I waited 2 weeks for it to be made and shipped, and then once I received it, the lever ended up being some random hydraulic clutch lever. Not sure how that could get screwed up so badly, so now it&#8217;s back to square one for the brake lever. I have the stock one on there for now. This did let me do some thinking, and I&#8217;m probably going to mismatch the levers on purpose and go back to CRG and full length for the brake side.<\/p>\n<p>The new clutch cable, I took the opportunity to go with a stainless steel braided one. It was a bit of a pain to get adjusted because the Barnett cable was a bit shorter in length than the stock one.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/barnettclutch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-738\" title=\"barnettclutch\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/barnettclutch-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/barnettclutch-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/barnettclutch.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I also bled the rear brakes and put in ATE SuperBlue fluid. While I was in there, I changed out the reservoir&#8217;s line to tygon tubing.<\/p>\n<p>Another task I had on my hand was to redo the exterior and look of the bike. As I mentioned earlier, I wasn&#8217;t particularly fond of the SM610&#8217;s aesthetics. I decided to revert back to an older style from a more race oriented bike, the SMR570. The chassis were similar, so the body panels could be interchanged&#8230; for the most part.<\/p>\n<p>The left rear side panel probably required the most modification. I&#8217;ll skip on all the details of what I did with the panels.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-743\" title=\"sm570\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570right.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-742\" title=\"sm570right\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570right-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570right-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/sm570right.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With a new tail piece, I redid the wiring and installed a set of sleeker DRC turn signals and LED rear tail light.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ledtaillight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-737\" title=\"ledtaillight\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ledtaillight-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ledtaillight-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ledtaillight.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Moving to the front of the bike, I actually went with a headlight and mask from a &#8217;08-&#8217;11 KTM EXC-R. It looked much better in my opinion and had a slim profile. Although purchased new, the headlight mask had scratches on it. Not realizing the gloss black was only a base coat without clear, I tried buffing out the scratches with rubbing compound. This smeared the paint and made everything cloudy and worse&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I have to be thorough with what I do, so I took the mask to a nearby body shop where they promptly ripped me off. $50 later, I get a paintjob that had runs and didn&#8217;t even stick. One crevice had the paint bulging up, and picking at it revealed that there was basically no prep work. The entire paint job peeled off like a sticker. The base was only lightly sanded and was still very smooth and slippery. I then took the mask to the body shop that painted my CBR&#8217;s SharkSkinz, and they returned quality (although it costed me another $100). This is probably the most expensive supermoto headlight ever now, but at least the install wasn&#8217;t too bad. I&#8217;m happy with the end product.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ktmheadlight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-740\" title=\"ktmheadlight\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ktmheadlight-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ktmheadlight-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/ktmheadlight.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While I was at the second body shop, I had them clean up the holes I drilled into the air box cover.
