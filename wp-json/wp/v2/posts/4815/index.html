What were once considered to be my dream set of wheels have now grown stale. The underlying reason behind my change of heart is that the RegaMasters simply looked <em>too<\/em> stock.<\/p>\n<p>Most of what I&#8217;ve done so far, at least aesthetically, with this RX-7, I&#8217;ve done with the best intentions to preserve the stock look. I chose to err on the side of caution and play the conservative, mature card. All of that started to get boring, so it&#8217;s time to turn things up a notch. The RegaMasters looked great in their 17&#8243; size and I was happy with the outcome, but again, they looked like wheels that could have come with the car from Mazda. While I don&#8217;t miss the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/09\/work-xd9s-ride-height-adjustment\/\">XD9&#8217;s<\/a>, I do miss the black-on-black look. I also wanted to go back to 18&#8243; for the increased presence and appeal.<\/p>\n<p>If I was going to retire the RegaMasters, it would have to be in favor of a setup that would be a worthy successor. After conducting my fair share of research and debating over what wheels truly compliment an RX-7, I ultimately pursued a set of wheels that I&#8217;ve always wanted&#8230; and by that, I mean since back in the days of my first RX-7. Finally, the time was ripe to bring to fruition a setup that had lingered in my mind for years &#8211; Dark Gunmetal Advan RS&#8217;s for the rear and RZ&#8217;s for the front. The mismatch is purposeful. To the untrained eye, both wheels will look indifferent at first glance. It&#8217;s this subtle dichotomy that adds an appreciable detail to the overall package of the car.<\/p>\n<p>I called upon the same contact I used in Japan to buy me the RegaMasters for these Advans. They were out of stock from Mackin, the USA distributor, and ordering through a Stateside vendor typically takes months for delivery. I took a shortcut by asking my guy to buy these wheels directly from Advan Japan, and then DHL Air Mail them to me. Once they were shipped, they only took about 2-3 days to arrive at my doorstep!<\/p>\n<p>Another reason why I chose to go with this Advan set is because the sizings available were <em>PERFECT<\/em> for the FD3S. And yes, staying true to form, I stuck with yet another 10&#8243; wide, 255 squared setup. With each past iteration of wheels, I&#8217;ve adjusted the sizing incrementally. The rears on the XD9&#8217;s protruded too much for my tastes, and the fronts were too sunken in. I improved the fitment with the RegaMasters by bringing the rears in (they were +20 offset versus the XD9s&#8217; +18). I also spaced the fronts to +35 effective. In summation, the RegaMasters sat 2mm inboard in the rear, and 3mm outboard in the front. However, to REALLY dial things in, I felt that the rears could still be more &#8220;flush&#8221; and the fronts could fill up the fenders slightly more.<\/p>\n<p>Building upon all of this, I found the sizes Advan offered to be exactly what I needed this time around. The rears RS&#8217;s are 18&#215;10&#8243; +25 (5mm inboard versus the RegaMasters) and the front RZ&#8217;s are 18&#215;10&#8243; +35 (same effective). My tire choice is what ties everything together. 255\/35\/18 is a very good\u00a0sizing for a stock body FD3S, and that&#8217;s what I stayed with&#8230; except in the form of beefier Toyo R888&#8217;s. I know better by now than to skimp on tires. Having proper rubbers will really spearhead a successful wheel package. Plus, I&#8217;ve always wanted to run R-Comps &#8211; treadwear and overkilling be damned.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a picture of the wheels laid flat to show their concavity. They are all the deeper, GTR faces.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gtrface.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4819\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gtrface-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"gtrface\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gtrface-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gtrface-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/gtrface.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And mounted with the R888&#8217;s:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advanrs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4817\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advanrs-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"advanrs\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advanrs-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advanrs-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advanrs.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advan.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4816\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advan-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"advan\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advan-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advan-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/advan.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There was no way I could resist holding out, I threw them on one side of the car as soon as I could.
