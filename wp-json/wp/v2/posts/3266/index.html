Not completely ashamed of it, because downtime and decompression is a good way to balance out a routine 9-5 weekday. Sunday (yesterday), I took advantage of the clear weather by hiking up Mission Peak with my boy Blue. 3 Sundays ago, I sprained my left ankle to depths of the Earth&#8217;s core and back. I could swear my ankle rolled so far it actually touched the ground. This took nearly 3 weeks to recover, since it ended up being quite a severe sprain. Having to limp to work and then school the very next day was horrendous. And no, I didn&#8217;t bother with crutches because I am a boss. <\/p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t doubt if I ruptured a ligament, because a week into the sprain, dark bruising started appearing on both sides of my foot. Anyway, I&#8217;m not here to talk about an utterly retarded sprain (because it happened literally out of no where)&#8230; back to yesterday. In the afternoon, I woke my dog up from his nap and drove over to Mission Peak. This is how awesome a dog is to have&#8230; imagine trying to wake up a human companion from a nap and then go hike a 2500ft peak immediately after. <\/p>\n<p>The last time I was at Mission Peak, <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2011\/04\/hall-of-meat\/\">things didn&#8217;t go so smoothly<\/a>. Holding an unintentional yard sale with my blood and a chunk of my arm being the featured items is not a good business. Suffice to say, I decided to take it easy this time around. My motive for the hike certainly wasn&#8217;t to try and break records, but to obtain a much needed dose of cardio after being out of commission for 3 weeks. On the uphill, I maintained a consistent stride with jog breaks at intervals. Total time to the peak from the gate just behind the Ohlone College pond was 1 hour and 5 minutes including 2 breaks.<\/p>\n<p>Blue was a trooper, climbing up the boulders with him near the top was especially fun. Climbing down said boulders was a different experience, however. Here&#8217;s Blue at the top of the world&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/bluemission.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/bluemission-620x829.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"bluemission\" width=\"620\" height=\"829\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3267\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/bluemission-620x829.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/bluemission.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/dogpeak.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/dogpeak-620x829.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"dogpeak\" width=\"620\" height=\"829\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3268\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/dogpeak-620x829.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/dogpeak.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As I was getting ready to head back, I remember someone asking me a couple of questions about my dog. It was so windy up there I think I completely misinterpreted everything, and proceeded to answer incorrectly as well. Hopefully it was close enough.<\/p>\n<p>The downhill back to the pond gate was accomplished in 40 minutes, including the break at the top. I was able to jog most of its entirety. I will admit to being conscious on how I planted my steps, so as to prevent another rolled ankle. Curiously, as I was casually strolling back to the car in the parking lot, I stepped on a rock and damn near rolled my right ankle. Luckily I was able bounce back from it, but that would&#8217;ve been kind of cruel otherwise. <\/p>\n<p>I know more time can be made up on the uphill if I jogged it more. Next time, I will want to push and hope to bring the round trip duration down to 1 hour and 30 minutes. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To recap the weekend, Saturday I did nothing.
