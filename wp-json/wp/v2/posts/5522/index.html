Granted, power and torque was abundant right from the beginning, but the tune really helped translate that power into an even more linear scope. This is one of the reasons why I am just not a turbo guy (aside from the added complications) &#8211; no boost lag is a convenience that you can&#8217;t easily forget.<\/p>\n<p>I never thought I&#8217;d say this, but I feel that the car is finally nearing completion. While you can never be 100% done with something like this, I&#8217;d say that I&#8217;ve finally broken into the 90% territory. About time since 90% of the car is essentially different or upgraded.<\/p>\n<p>I am turning my attention to working out a few minor bugs:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Occasionally, the ignition requires a couple tries before the starter engages. It has never failed to start, so the problem is either with the ignition switch, a relay, or possibly a need for more grounding.<\/li>\n<li>I would prefer that the clutch engages a bit higher. Might switch the Wilwood clutch master cylinder for a slightly larger bore.<\/li>\n<li>The way the fuel pump is priming on key on needs to be tweaked.<\/li>\n<li>Coolant temperature gauge still does not work. It is for certain that the LS3 performs exceedingly well temperature wise. I have been relying on the added digital oil temperature gauge in the glovebox as a crutch. Oil temps have never gone higher than 210* Fahrenheit, even after back-to-back dyno pulls.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The solution I have in mind for point #4 is going to be far grander than the simple fix that&#8217;s required&#8230; but that&#8217;s for another post.<\/p>\n<p>Reverting to point #1, I purchased a new ignition switch to see if that would solve the issue. Furthermore, replacing the ignition switch is good maintenance, regardless. The way I bought the ignition switch is quite interesting. I purchased an &#8220;aftermarket&#8221; Beck \/ Arnley ignition switch from Newegg.com (yes, the computer retailer) of all places. While the Beck \/ Arnley part was almost half the price of Mazda, my intentions were not to skimp&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Upon receiving the switch, the words Made in Japan are curiously labeled.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0848.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5527\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0848-777x1036.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0848\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0848-777x1036.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0848.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Take a guess what lay inside &#8211; an OEM Mazda part!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0849.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5526\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0849-777x582.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0849\" width=\"777\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0849-777x582.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0849-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0849.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Replacing the ignition switch was an easy affair and can be accessed by removing the steering column&#8217;s surround.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0850.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5524\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0850-777x1036.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0850\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0850-777x1036.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0850.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Next, I took the time to give the car another oil change. Although there was only a couple hundred miles on the engine, I figured it would be beneficial to do so anyway given the dyno tuning. I&#8217;ve either become spoiled and reluctant, or simply lazy&#8230; but I refuse to lift my car with floor jacks and jack stands anymore. I brought the RX-7 over to a buddy&#8217;s shop after hours to do the oil change.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0908.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5528\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0908-777x1036.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0908\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0908-777x1036.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0908.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0863.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5523\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0863-777x582.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0863\" width=\"777\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0863-777x582.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0863-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_0863.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I never thought I would bring my car anywhere outside of home for washing&#8230; but those self-wash coin car places are great.
