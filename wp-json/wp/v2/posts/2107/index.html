I already <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2011\/04\/moving-on\/\">wasted months<\/a> looking and buying parts for a car that never happened. I&#8217;m really happy with the progress on the Miata so far. In order to reach this point, I&#8217;ve had to work consistently. That means spending a few hours on the car, every day.

When possible, it&#8217;s far easier in the long-run to get all the parts at one time, and get it over with in one pass. Why wait?
