It&#8217;s modern, it&#8217;s Euro, and it&#8217;s amazing. My Dad sold his car only a couple weeks prior to me selling the Miata&#8230; so our family only had the trusty Prius to drive. Made figuring out how to commute difficult, so needless to say, I was in a time crunch to find a car fast. I entertained the idea of other vehicles and even checked out an M5, but eventually decided on a 1 series. Craigslist didn&#8217;t yield any promising results when searching in California, so I searched further North and found the right match: Alpine white, 24,000 miles, still has warranty, sport package, and stick shift. Ended up buying and shipping this car, and it arrived from Oregon this Thursday.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/bmw135i.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2890\" title=\"bmw135i\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/bmw135i-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/bmw135i-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/bmw135i-900x675.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/bmw135i.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I drove it to work the next day and a few interesting details stood out for me, firstly the\u00a0Fit and Finish&#8230; you buy a BMW for a reason and it shows. The car just <em>feels<\/em>\u00a0like quality. Also, I noticed the intricacies BMW has imparted: the windows roll down slightly when opening\/closing the doors; the radio dims down the volume before switching to another station; when stopped on a hill, if you let off the brakes to accelerate, the car maintains braking for a second; once rolling, the car automatically locks the door, but when parked, pulling on the door handle 2 times will unlock &#038; open. <\/p>\n<p>Although I&#8217;ve only had the 135i for a brief period, the <em>difference<\/em> between this and all my previous cars is readily apparent. This car is like a complete 180\u00b0 from the Miata, it has creature comforts and feels refined. I&#8217;m loving it, I wish I didn&#8217;t have to go through 5 other cars to get to this level, but hopefully now I can also break the mold of constantly buying &#038; selling. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I want to start off by recapping all the cars I&#8217;ve owned in the past 6 years, in chronological order: &#8217;92 Nissan 300zx, &#8217;93 Mazda RX-7, &#8217;96 Mazda Miata, &#8217;91 Toyota Previa, &#8217;97 Mazda Miata.
