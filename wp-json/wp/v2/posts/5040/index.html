For one, the weather has been strangely cold during the past couple of weeks. Going into my garage feels like I&#8217;ve stepped into a refrigerator. Needless to say, I wasn&#8217;t privy to turning wrenches in numbing temperatures. <\/p>\n<p>Breaking away indoors has allowed me to work on a new idea that I&#8217;ve recently become enamored about &#8211; and that is a new website. Before I got into cars and before I could even drive, my childhood hobby was playing with Photoshop and creating websites. I still fondly remember my days in Junior High when I read books on HTML and CSS. I used to pump out websites serially, they were all mostly nonsense, of course, but offered valuable practice. And now I&#8217;ve come to a realization that Grand Mighty had become my sole domain and my rate of experimenting with new websites had come to a standstill. I think now is a good time to give something else a go. <\/p>\n<p>All the countless forums and random websites I made in the past were mostly vague and general, with no specific topic. If you recall, the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2011\/12\/forums-are-open\/\">Grand Mighty Forums<\/a> didn&#8217;t exactly bloom. And a product of no purpose typically dissolves. <\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m actually, finally, attempting a website aimed at a niche&#8230; and that is RX-7&#8217;s! While there are quite a few large RX-7 related forums out there, they all seem unattached and cumbersome. I&#8217;ve noticed that the community aspect on RX7Club, for example, is quite segregated and remote. This is partially the reason why I seldom post there, aside from classified ads and other necessities. My goal is to bring in a new flavor to the RX-7 community, one that is smaller scale but emphasizes quality. I think the key to a worthwhile enthusiast community is that it should remain with the enthusiasts, for the enthusiasts. Many of these large automotive boards are owned and operated by Internet Brands, a corporation that inherently prioritizes making profits. It&#8217;s also funny to note how outdated (forum software wise) and bland the boards are. <\/p>\n<p>So with that, I bring to you <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\">7TUNED.com<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/7tunedpromo-777x582.jpg\" alt=\"7tunedpromo\" width=\"777\" height=\"582\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5041\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/7tunedpromo-777x582.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/7tunedpromo-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/7tunedpromo.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Although it is RX-7 and Rotary car specific, I implore you to give it a try regardless, especially if you have any interest in these cars at all. <\/p>\n<p>The next goal is to add on a Wiki \/ Knowledgebase section where FAQs and Guides will be listed. There are a lot of useful information on these cars scattered around the Internet, it should be beneficial to funnel them into a more centralized and easily readable hub.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While the progress on my RX-7&#8217;s interior project is approaching its finale, yet at a creeping pace, I&#8217;ve turned my attention into other areas.
