Well, I did spend hours wrestling on a stupid U-Haul hitch for the Prius, but that&#8217;ll be another post.<\/p>\n<p>After having the car back for a day, I decided to ramp up the speed. I found a local roadster guy who does mechanic work on the side, and arranged for him to come by this morning. Funny thing is, he turned out to be someone I knew from a few years ago, way back when I was first getting into cars. The main objective for today was to do a full timing belt service. I chose to have someone else that is more experienced with the process do this because it will get it done more efficiently and faster (it&#8217;d take me days to do it the first time). And the faster things are completed, the faster I can actually start driving this car. The whole glamor of working on cars wore off on me, it&#8217;s a chore when you have to do it over and over again.<\/p>\n<p>I also had another plan in mind, and that was to get the differential taken out and a Tomei 2-Way LSD put in. So the differential was yanked in the morning and then I did my part in getting the LSD taken care of.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/miatadiffremoval.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1994\" title=\"miatadiffremoval\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/miatadiffremoval-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/miatadiffremoval-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/miatadiffremoval.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/differentialpluck.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1992\" title=\"differentialpluck\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/differentialpluck-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/differentialpluck-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/differentialpluck.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>First, I drove the differntial and the Tomei unit down to Blacktrax Performance, but when I got there, the guy said he couldn&#8217;t guarantee completion by the end of the day. Not good enough for me, and the LSD install was also pretty pricey&#8230; so I then drove back up to Pete&#8217;s Gear Shop in Hayward. PR Motorsports sends all their differential and LSD work there. They were able to install the LSD with proper backlashing measurements, etc. by the end of the day &#8211; and were also much cheaper.\u00a0Driving into Hayward sucked though, all the construction going on there makes the roads super congested and bumpy.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the timing belt service&#8230; here&#8217;s a before picture of the engine bay (no point because I didn&#8217;t take an after picture yet, but whatever):<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/enginebaybefore.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1993\" title=\"enginebaybefore\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/enginebaybefore-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/enginebaybefore-600x800.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/enginebaybefore.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The box with all the new seals and belts, bought from Finishline-Rosenthal Mazda.
