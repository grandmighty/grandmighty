All-white (and by white, it needs to be <em>white<\/em>&#8230; not an off-white or cream) walls with 90\u00b0 corners. I&#8217;m not into the whole rounded-corners-with-differently-colored-rooms look. I think I&#8217;d also prefer the walls to be non-textured. The living space is also modestly sized; I rather have a house that&#8217;s on the small size than one with too much space. Generously partitioned open areas are a must. Bisecting a floorplan into an unnecessary number of rooms should be an architectural crime. Most importantly, there is no TV &#8211; just a nice shelf with books. That is how to live proper, in my opinion. The Miami Vice-era Ferrari should go, however, not into it. From a purely aesthetics standpoint, I can agree that the car&#8217;s color complements the neutral tones in the picture&#8230; it&#8217;s just too bad that the car itself is so ugly. A 60&#8217;s Berlinetta would have been far more favored.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/moderninterior.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/moderninterior-600x377.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"moderninterior\" width=\"600\" height=\"377\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2685\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/moderninterior-600x377.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/moderninterior-900x566.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/moderninterior.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This house&#8217;s interior is aligned with my personal goals: no clutter, minimalistic, baring only the essentials.
