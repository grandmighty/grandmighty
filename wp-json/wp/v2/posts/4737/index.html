With the single turbo conversion finally completed and the car running beautifully&#8230; what&#8217;s the next move? <\/p>\n<p>From the very beginning when the idea to buy another RX-7 popped into my mind almost exactly a year ago, I acknowledged what I would be getting myself into. I was equipped with enough experience, having gone through multiple projects and builds in the past, to know that this would be a similar process. Just on an even grander scale. I knew that this RX-7 would be my most ambitious undertaking to date, and had to accept all the sacrifices that followed. I think the underlying reason why I would even willingly desire such a lofty goal stems from a determination to push. It was this same determination that ultimately saw me through the project and up to this point today. <\/p>\n<p>The amount of work I invested into this car was compressed into a relatively short time span of less than a year. This meant that throughout its duration, I would have to constantly think about the car or work on it. There was no such thing as a break, and there certainly wasn&#8217;t time to do much else on top of my day job and school work. Life wasn&#8217;t easy, but I was cognizant of the challenge I subjected myself to. I looked at the situation as if I was tackling a very large and intricate puzzle. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to the labor and time involved, the near psychotic levels of money spending made the whole endeavor monumentally exhausting. Not only did I have to buy a low-mileage RX-7 to start, it didn&#8217;t even end up accounting for half of the equation. I remember maxing out my credit card repeatedly over the course of the previous Winter. At the minimum, I received 4-5 packages in the mail on a weekly basis for months whilst undergoing the single turbo work. <\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s next for me is to take a step back and enjoy some fresh air &#8211; away from all the oil-filled chemicals in the garage, away from the long nights of toiling work, and away from the financially burdening habit of buying parts. My vision for the car is finally realized to an extent that I can be satisfied with. I have conquered a seemingly insurmountable task, to prove that it can be done with tact and perseverance. I know there&#8217;s only enough will and strength in me to have one go-around at this. So now it&#8217;s time to reap the benefits and move on&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>My plan is to actually focus on returning to a normal life, a life that isn&#8217;t consumed by a single thought. I&#8217;ve been quite busy lately keeping active lifestyle because my first motivation is to try and reinstate the years I know I lost from working on all these projects over the years. The amount of stress endured definitely accumulates to a significant toll. <\/p>\n<p>The change in pace lately has been great, but I know one thing is for certain&#8230; albeit I&#8217;m at the end of one &#8220;hobby,&#8221; I&#8217;ll have to pick something else up to fill the gap. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll end up feeling bored and dull. Definitely no more cars though, I&#8217;ve been down that road for far too long now. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Updates have been lacking recently on the website because in all honesty, I opted to take a break.
