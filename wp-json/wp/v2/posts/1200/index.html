Figured if I&#8217;m going to sit at a desk, I might as well get some passive training out of it. What are the benefits? For one, not having a back support means I can&#8217;t be lazy and slouch. Sitting on an exercise ball also provides better circulation, and not to mention a better sense of balance given its unstable surface. It&#8217;s also really cheap (balling on a budget?), in my case I went to Walmart and bought the ball for $15. Great for trying the idea out, but I want to upgrade to a better ball soon, since this cheap one doesn&#8217;t hold air nor its shape well (gets lopsided).<\/p>\n<p>People over 5&#8217;10&#8221; should get the 75cm size versus the 65cm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here&#8217;s a look at my &#8220;office.&#8221; Nothing fancy, but the old desk I was using drastically needed updating.
