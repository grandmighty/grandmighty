Good work takes time, which is why I have been compliant and patient&#8230; but believe me, it&#8217;s been an anxious wait. I swung by the shop again today on my way home from work to check on the car, and it&#8217;s looking good. The main body work is done and the car itself has been sprayed already. Completion is near, but still about a week away. <\/p>\n<p>I took a couple of pictures, although these are basically useless because 1.) I used my camera phone on a black car in the sun and 2.) the clearcoat is cut (wetsanded before polishing) at this stage. Hard to tell, but the lower majority of the car is all sanded. I can&#8217;t wait to see it all shine in the finished form.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/williamsautobody.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/williamsautobody-620x829.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"williamsautobody\" width=\"620\" height=\"829\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3750\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/williamsautobody-620x829.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/williamsautobody.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/rx7body.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/rx7body-620x463.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"rx7body\" width=\"620\" height=\"463\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3749\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/rx7body-620x463.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/rx7body-800x597.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/rx7body.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The hood was discovered to have strange, tiny waterspot-like blotches all over. They are only visible up close and under certain lighting, but that is no excuse and I decided to continue with having it repainted. Originally, the hood was going to be the single body panel that would not be touched.<\/p>\n<p>Now the entire car will have a new PPG Global clearcoat. Interestingly, I also learned today that Mazda used single-stage paint for all the solid colors of the RX-7: Brilliant Black, Chaste White, and Vintage Red (only Montego Blue, Competition Yellow Mica, and Silver Stone Metallic came in 2-stage with clear). I was never a fan of Mazda&#8217;s factory paint to begin with, but this detail further justifies all the effort that is being exerted into essentially &#8220;converting&#8221; the paintwork to a modern, high-quality 2-stage. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is now coming to the end of the 5th week since I first dropped the RX-7 off at the body shop.
