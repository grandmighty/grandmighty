When I was hunting down the couplers I needed, many of the other brands did not have all the sizes in stock. This lead me to SiliconeIntakes.com, which benefits from a readily available inventory. <\/p>\n<p>They were well priced too, so I decided to try them out. The couplers are made from a 4-ply construction as advertised, but after inspecting them in person, something about the quality was off to me. <\/p>\n<p>I was then turned to SiliconeHose.com and decided to re-buy my set of couplers. These ones are made by Flex Technologies in-house at their Southern California location. I was far more impressed with the build of these couplers, they felt dense, rigid, and less noodle-like in comparison to SiliconeIntakes&#8217; product. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecomparison.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecomparison-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"siliconecomparison\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4566\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecomparison-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecomparison-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecomparison.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecouplers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecouplers-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"siliconecouplers\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4567\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecouplers-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecouplers-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/siliconecouplers.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>SiliconeIntakes (2.5&#8243; to 3&#8243; reducer) is on the left and Flex Technologies (2.75&#8243; to 3&#8243; reducer) is on the right.
