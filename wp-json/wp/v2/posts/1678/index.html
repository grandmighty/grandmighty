The funny thing is, I was originally looking for a 97-98 &#8220;Kouki&#8221; 240sx because I liked its stock appearance, and I wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with bodywork. Plus, I thought the front end on the late model S14&#8217;s looked far better than the 95-96 &#8220;Zenkis.&#8221; As I delved deeper into S14s over time, my taste in the matter took a sudden change.<\/p>\n<p>I initially discarded the desire to buy a Zenki because, like most other people, I found them to be ugly. It&#8217;s true though, completely stock and USDM, their front ends are rather plain and hideous&#8230; However, it doesn&#8217;t take a whole lot to make them stunning, in my opinion. They&#8217;re an\u00a0acquired\u00a0taste. Once I came across pictures of this bumper, the deal was sealed. I knew there could be no alternative.<\/p>\n<p>Although I&#8217;m going to have to get this bumper painted, I decided it was worth the trouble. Simply because this is the sexiest bumper in the world. Hyperbole aside, the NaVan bumper is actually an OEM product and made out of \u00a0TPO or Polypropylene (I&#8217;m not a fan of aftermarket fiberglass aero). I don&#8217;t know the full story\/history of Navan, but it was a special package offered by Nissan in Japan, and only for Zenkis.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbrochure.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1681\" title=\"navanbrochure\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbrochure-600x488.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbrochure-600x488.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbrochure.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navan.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1683\" title=\"navan\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navan-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navan-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navan.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is the bumper.\u00a0Pricey and I had to buy it from a vendor in Malaysia, but this particular one was the cleanest I could source. Most others had chunks missing from the bottom lip. One feature of this bumper that I&#8217;m not sold on is the center opening, which has the large vents (&#8220;+&#8221;). I&#8217;m planning on having those removed to keep it cleaner.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbumper.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1682\" title=\"navanbumper\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbumper-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbumper-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/navanbumper.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Today, I added fiberglass to the upper corners and around the fender mounting holes.
