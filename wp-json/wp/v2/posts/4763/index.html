Do more with less (and increase reliability by virtue). To date, I have removed the windshield wipers and motor, power steering, air conditioning, air pump, and now the ABS. The single turbo conversion, of course, accounts for a slew of other simplifications. I wouldn&#8217;t have this car any other way. If it was easily feasible, I&#8217;d probably convert the power windows to manual roll-ups&#8230; and I&#8217;m only being semi-facetious here. <\/p>\n<p>I know removing the ABS can raise controversy, but after doing my diligence, I concluded that it was worthy of the axe. First, early 90&#8217;s era ABS technology cannot compare to the accuracy offered by units of contemporary times. The technology has come a long ways, and the older counterparts leave much to be desired. Advances in the field such as computer driven traction and stability control are becoming the norm nowadays, whereas ABS was just starting to be commonplace when the FD was released. Given what an ABS must do to perform effectively, its inherent sophistication did not compliment well with the more crude and mechanical units of the 90&#8217;s. Notably, people who track their RX-7&#8217;s have complained of the ABS interfering. <\/p>\n<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I doubt the ABS is capable enough to be the saving grace and difference in an emergency situation. I would rather rely on my own braking ability and discretion. Plus, having 255 tires all-around with the increased stopping force of the BBK should certainly tip the favor. <\/p>\n<p>In general, 90&#8217;s (Japanese) sports cars offer a very tappable platform for tuning and modifying. Additionally, they were also relatively raw and spartan, placing emphasis on the driver and not computers and gizmos. These characteristics explain why I&#8217;m so acclimated towards the RX-7, and I feel that the spirit of focus and refinement should be leveraged to its fullest extent. <\/p>\n<p>Continuing on, here is the stock ABS pump, which dominates the back corner of the engine bay. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/abspump.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/abspump-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"abspump\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4767\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/abspump-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/abspump-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/abspump.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A savvy member on RX7Club put together and resold an ABS Delete Kit, which consists of XRP -3 SS Brake Lines, various fittings and adapter, and a SSBC Proportioning Valve. After yanking out the ABS pump and all of its associated brake hardlines, I routed in the new lines and fittings. Definitely cleans up the engine bay! I wrapped the line that crossed the engine bay in gold reflective tape.<\/p>\n<p>The Delete Kit was a great bundle overall, but there were a few areas I was not satisfied with. For instance, there were 2 lines that had sharp bends in them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/oldlines.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/oldlines-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"oldlines\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4768\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/oldlines-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/oldlines-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/oldlines.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I also wasn&#8217;t comfortable with the aluminum fittings that were included. On top of durability concerns in a high pressure environment like a brake system, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.helusa.com\/info\/aluminum-fittings.html\">electrolytic corrosion<\/a> can take place when dissimilar metals are used together. I ended up rebuying the aluminum fittings in stainless steel from XRP (that Tee fitting in SS was almost $50 alone!). I also ordered a pair of new brake lines that had a 90* crimp, to help optimize the bends. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/xrp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/xrp-777x585.jpg\" alt=\"xrp\" width=\"777\" height=\"585\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4771\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/xrp-777x585.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/xrp-960x723.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/xrp.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the new setup with 90* hose ends, even if it meant having to bleed the brakes all over again. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/90degreeline.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/90degreeline-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"90degreeline\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4765\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/90degreeline-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/90degreeline-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/90degreeline.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stainlessbraided.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stainlessbraided-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"stainlessbraided\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4770\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stainlessbraided-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stainlessbraided-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/stainlessbraided.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The proportioning valve leads to the rear brakes and allows for bias adjustments.
