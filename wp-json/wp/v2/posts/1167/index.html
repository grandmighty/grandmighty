It was easy to make excuses like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll get them out when they start to really hurt&#8230;&#8221; Assuredly, extracting wisdom teeth at the earliest convenience is the wisest approach (bad pun, whatever).<\/p>\n<p>My wisdom teeth weren&#8217;t really painful for me (yet anyway), the intervals of discomfort were spread apart and brief. I knew they had to come out regardless, however, since my lower 2 teeth were impacted, and were also crowding my front teeth. With about 2 more weeks of break before school starts for me, I <em>finally<\/em> took the much delayed initiative and hit the fast forward button. <\/p>\n<p>I went to my routine Dentist earlier this month for a bi-annual cleaning, and had her refer me to the Maxilliofacial Surgery Center in San Jose. I then went there on Wednesday for consulting, and promptly scheduled the operation for the next morning.The experience was a bit scary because of how impacted my lower ones were, and they were fairly close to the mandibular nerve. Suffering permanent post-paresthesia from damaging the nerve is a small possibility, but still a possibility&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Luckily my Doctor was a Boss and I didn&#8217;t have any lingering numbness afterwards. I must say, General Anesthesia works really well. Due to its amnesic effects, all I can remember from the operation was the preparation stuff. Once that IV was in my arm, I was gone within a minute. I was told the actual removal of my three wisdom teeth (I also had one on top that grew out normal, never had a fourth) took only about 15 minutes. I have very fleeting recollections of sitting in a wheelchair, asking my Dad questions in the car, and then lying down on a recliner at home.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually the local anesthesia wore off in my mouth, and I woke up from that recliner in a lot of pain. My whole mouth was really sore, and I was drooling out blood for a while. I popped a few pills, including a Vicodin, but the pain wasn&#8217;t subsiding much. I later decided to remove the blood stained gauzes in my mouth, eat one more Vicodin, and go back to bed. I&#8217;m glad the bleeding was controlled, because I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to shoving in fresh gauzes and biting down on them. Through the pain, I was still able to fall asleep.<\/p>\n<p>I think plenty of rest offered a lot of relief, because the first day&#8217;s pain disappeared almost entirely today. I&#8217;m currently restricting my diet to tea, water, and apple sauce (doing my best to avoid disturbing the blood clots because I DON&#8217;T want a dry socket). The last time I ate anything substantial was a burrito on Wednesday afternoon. I&#8217;ve lost close to 4 pounds already, pretty amazing.<\/p>\n<p>Overall this whole ordeal wasn&#8217;t bad at all. I&#8217;m extremely relieved I got them out, it was like having a lingering rain cloud over my head for the past couple of years.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After prolonging the inevitable, I finally got my wisdom teeth removed yesterday.
