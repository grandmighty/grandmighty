Then I went over to REI and got some water bottles and some new insoles. The Sidi&#8217;s insoles might as well be made out of printer paper, because they feel horrible. The new insoles made a huge difference in terms of comfort and support.<\/p>\n<p>I finally have all the essential items from a long list, so it was time to do an actual ride. I was trying to ride with some people, but that ended up taking forever as it usually does, so I just head out anyway. I ended up finding my way to Coyote Hills which was windy as always. The bike and gear felt really good, very pleased. I wore some padded shorts because the Toupe saddle is super uncomfortable otherwise. I&#8217;m a believer of padded shorts, saddle soreness wasn&#8217;t a problem at all today. I&#8217;m also a believer in gear changes, I used to think it wasn&#8217;t that vital, but now when I&#8217;ve actually used it, I realize how useful it is. In defense, when I got into the whole trendy fixed gear deal a couple years ago, it did get me into cycling regardless of practicality or &#8220;fad&#8221; appeals. My previous bicycles have been single speeds (fixed gear and a dirtjumper that mutilated my shins).<\/p>\n<p>When I did longer rides on my old fixed gear bikes, I just wore casual clothing. Very squiddish in terms of cycling. Needless to say, the discomfort from the saddle was a huge problem. Now, I will not ride unless I have on my padded shorts.<\/p>\n<p>The ride today was fun. The headwind was a little tough, but the tailwind really picked up my momentum. I took a break somewhere on a hill in the Coyote Hills park:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/coyotehills.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-390\" title=\"coyotehills\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/coyotehills-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/coyotehills-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/coyotehills.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My bike taking a break:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/specializedsl.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-391\" title=\"specializedsl\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/specializedsl-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/specializedsl-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/specializedsl.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When going over some rough bumps at speed, the bike would feel noticeably weightless. I still need to get used to the whole set up more. I&#8217;m a big noob when trying to clip into the pedals, I have to look down to see if the pedal is flipped up or not, etc. That, and I think I need to get better at cornering with this thing. A bicycle feels more awkward than leaning and turning with a motorcycle. I went into a turn a little too hot on a descent which was exciting.<\/p>\n<p>Other than that, the ride wasn&#8217;t long at all. I&#8217;m going to try to gradually build up my ride intensities and distances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, I went over to a local bike shop and picked up a pair of Specilized BG-Comp gloves.
