Instead of having the clutch pedal gradually fall to the floor, it would randomly fall to the floor and then come back up. The usual pattern was no longer observable, which disproved the theory of an air bubble expanding with heat. The next step was to simply replace the Wilwood 7\/8&#8243; master cylinder with another new unit &#8211; this ended up solving the problem. In one way or another, the previous Wilwood master cylinder I picked up from Hinson Supercars was defective. Similarly, Marcus ran into issues with the 929 1&#8243; master cylinder while bleeding the brakes&#8230; it wouldn&#8217;t hold fluid properly. In the end, both the brake and clutch master cylinders were initially purchased new and\u00a0both were defective and needed replacing.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, the clutch is working flawlessly now and that&#8217;s all that matters. Once Marcus was done, I asked him to directly\u00a0drop the car off at William&#8217;s AutoBody to have the &#8217;99 spoiler installed, and I picked the car up from there. More on the spoiler in the upcoming post.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/garage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5453\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/garage-777x508.jpg\" alt=\"garage\" width=\"777\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/garage-777x508.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/garage-960x628.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/garage.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Later in the week, I scheduled a late-night appointment with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trackspecauto.com\">Trackspec Autosports<\/a> in Fremont to get the alignment knocked out.

A large displacement V8 in a light Japanese chassis is truly a savage combination&#8230; the car pulls like an animal and picks up speed like the rotary never did. You might think having such a linear power band would be counter-intuitive to the sensation of speed, since it&#8217;s too smooth, but that is far from the truth. Having torque on tap and a constant pull is the epitome of &#8220;fast&#8221;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Attempts were made to re-bleed the clutch but its behavior started to become increasingly erratic.
