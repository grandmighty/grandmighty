The <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/09\/pioneer-avh-p8400bh\/\">Pioneer headunit<\/a> I installed did appreciate the quality by offering a boost in amps, but there was still room for improvement. With the rear speakers removed, the entire soundstage pivoted on just the pair of door speakers, and in a way, they created a bottleneck. My goal was to do a simple upgrade, I didn&#8217;t want to get carried away and run new wiring or add an external amplifier. Updating the door speakers would be sufficient for my needs. Although having a nice stereo system is important, it still plays a more secondary role in respect to the car&#8217;s overall scheme and focus. A quadruple-digit wattage setup is more fitting in a daily, or the like. <\/p>\n<p>I had to hold myself back even further when it came time to shop for a new set of speakers. Instinctively, I started my search with high-end coaxial speakers before realizing the folly. Buying expensive speakers to be powered off of factory wiring and only a head unit would be the epitome of overkill. After more careful researching, I settled on the Morel Maximo 6.5&#8243; coaxials. The Maximos are actually Morel&#8217;s entry level speakers, so you can imagine the amount of self-control required for me to make this choice (lol). Regardless, these are still relatively midrange and reviews on their quality have been abundantly praiseful. I favored the Maximos namely because of their good sensitivity rating (90.5db) versus other alternatives I was weighing. Sensitivity is correlated with a speaker&#8217;s efficiency. The higher the efficiency, the better the speaker is able to convert electrical watts into acoustical watts &#8211; which is especially important when you&#8217;re foregoing an external amplifier. <\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the larger, 6.5&#8243; Morel looks like next to an old, stock speaker.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/morelmaximo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/morelmaximo-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"morelmaximo\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4909\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/morelmaximo-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/morelmaximo-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/morelmaximo.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>To mount the speakers into the door, I bought a pair of these PVC adapters from an elusive vendor. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/speakeradapter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/speakeradapter-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"speakeradapter\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4910\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/speakeradapter-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/speakeradapter-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/speakeradapter.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I say elusive because the seller has been known to ignore communications and not ship people their orders. I was lucky on my first order and received the adapters in a timely fashion. I later bought the same adapters again to have as spares and to modify, but I haven&#8217;t heard or received anything in weeks&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>The adapters fit decently, but the casing on the Maximos are slightly oversized so they do not sit perfectly flush inside the rings. I may decide to make my own adapters in the future, but unless the PVC adapters vibrate or cause an issue, there is no urgency to perfect them. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/65coaxial.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/65coaxial-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"65coaxial\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4908\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/65coaxial-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/65coaxial-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/65coaxial.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Since I had the door panels off for the speaker install, I also removed my driver-side window and then the regulator for servicing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowremoval.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowremoval-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"windowremoval\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4912\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowremoval-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowremoval-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowremoval.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With the regulator on my workbench, I cleaned and regreased all the cabling and tracks. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowregulator.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowregulator-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"windowregulator\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4911\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowregulator-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowregulator-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/windowregulator.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I noticed previously that the driver-side window moved a little slower than the passenger-side, so this will help everything slide more smoothly and hopefully enable the window to move up and down faster. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While I have been steadily trimming the fat from my RX-7 with intentions to &#8220;refine&#8221; it into a pure sports car, there is one feature that won&#8217;t be going anywhere: the stereo system!
