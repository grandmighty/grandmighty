The Braille battery I had was too big to fit. I was against having to relocate the battery inside the cabin because A.) I think a battery should stay in the engine bay, and B.) I didn&#8217;t want to extend wiring or mess with the factory configuration. I bought a Rotary Extreme mini-battery kit as the solution, and luckily, it fit <em>perfectly<\/em> with the Defined V-Mount. My anticipations of having to notch or shave material proved to be premature. Cross product compatibility is quite the convenience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/batterybox.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/batterybox-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"batterybox\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4490\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/batterybox-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/batterybox-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/batterybox.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another item I checked off the list was the fuel pump&#8217;s rewire. Even though the car has a higher-flowing Supra fuel pump, it won&#8217;t be able to perform as intended if the power delivery is insufficient. The stock wiring to the fuel pump is a guilty area of voltage drop. This is due to the redundancy incorporated into the circuit relay, which taps power from an ignition wire. <\/p>\n<p>By simply bypassing this wire and connecting it to a direct source of power (the battery), it has been shown to improve the fuel pump&#8217;s voltage by 2V. Another alternative is to go all out and completely obviate the stock harness by running new wiring front to rear, with the addition of a separate relay; however, I feel that this would be overstepping what I&#8217;m trying to achieve. And more relays equal more fail points. <\/p>\n<p>Thus, I opted for the former method. I cut the circuit relay&#8217;s ignition wire and redirected it to the battery with an inline 20A fuse. At the battery&#8217;s end, I cut off the insulation from a ring terminal and then crimped + soldered it on. I finished it off with marine heat shrink (this stuff has adhesive inside for extra weather-proofing) and mesh cable shielding. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/fuelpumprewire.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/fuelpumprewire-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"fuelpumprewire\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4493\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/fuelpumprewire-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/fuelpumprewire-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/fuelpumprewire.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My categorical imperative for this build is to avoid cutting corners &#8211; at all costs. I was immediately dissatisfied by the push-through zip ties holding on the single fan to the radiator. I knew it was going to be a matter of time for the tubes to get worn down and spring a leak, especially because all of the weight of the fan is being hoisted by them. I decided I didn&#8217;t want to drive with the fan mounted this way, not even once. <\/p>\n<p>What I needed was a custom bracket to hard mount the fan. How was I supposed to get this made, and quickly? I called Defined and opened my wallet. Thankfully, they were able to cook something up for me with a short turn-around time. In order to convince a busy shop to drop what they&#8217;re doing and focus on my job, I had to offer to pay double their work rates. Expensive, yes, but there is always an opportunity cost. At least I now have the fan&#8217;s mounting figured out and off of my mind. <\/p>\n<p>I first mounted the fan to the bracket with M5 stainless hardware, and then the bracket to the radiator&#8217;s bungs (which were there for the stock dual fans). <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/fanbracket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/fanbracket.jpg\" alt=\"fanbracket\" width=\"777\" height=\"1166\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4491\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And that is indeed a Chevrolet symbol.
