I&#8217;m not a huge fan of what Husqvarna did with the design of the panels, everything is sharp and straight. The front headlight is bulky and looks like an eagle eye or something.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, after researching and reading up the on the bike, I placed a couple orders&#8230; Those couple orders turned into this mountain of packages.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/mountainofpackages1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-713\" title=\"mountainofpackages\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/mountainofpackages1-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/mountainofpackages1-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/mountainofpackages1.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Still waiting on a few more items, but at least I could start. I put the kickstand back on to the CBR and borrowed its rear stand to get the Husky into the air.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/husqvarnawork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-712\" title=\"husqvarnawork\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/husqvarnawork-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/husqvarnawork-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/husqvarnawork.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I probably could&#8217;ve lived with the design of the body panels, but my biggest complaint with the bike&#8217;s aesthetics were the boring silver rims. Husqvarna also decided to go with a comparatively useless 4.25&#8243; rear rim. Those items posed a big enough of a &#8220;problem&#8221; for me that I opted to rebuild the wheels entirely. I went with a pair of Excel Takasago 17&#8243; supermoto rims in Black, with the rear being a 5&#8243; rim. I wanted to reuse the stock Husky hubs, but there was a catch. The stock drilling for the rims and hubs follows a European index, while the Excels use Japanese index. The situation was resolved by having <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buchananspokes.net\/\">Buchanan&#8217;s Spoke &amp; Rim<\/a> make a custom set of spokes that will mate up the Euro hubs to the Japanese Rims.<\/p>\n<p>Since I was redoing the wheels, I took the opportunity to ditch the junk stock Dunlop&#8217;s and go with something more proper. The tire combination I chose is relatively\u00a0unorthodox, with a race tire in the rear and a rain tire in the front. The rear is a 160\/60 Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa take-off I got off of eBay, and the front is a new 120\/70 Avon Pro Extreme Rain. The Avon may be a rain tire, but it is soft and sticky, and works great in the dry too.<\/p>\n<p>Today I took all my wheel stuff to Zoom Cycles in Santa Clara and had them lace everything up and mount the tires.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excelavonpxr.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-711\" title=\"excelavonpxr\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excelavonpxr-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excelavonpxr-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excelavonpxr.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excel5inch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-710\" title=\"excel5inch\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excel5inch-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excel5inch-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/excel5inch.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the CBR more or less settled in, it was time to turn my attention to the Husqvarna.
