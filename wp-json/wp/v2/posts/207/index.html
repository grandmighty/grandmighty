Emphasis on cheap. The main purpose of the car would be to commute around, but also to specifically transport my motorcycle&#8230; so I needed something bigger. One night I had a spontaneous thought to buy a Toyota Previa because it can fit a bike inside. When it comes to vans, the Previa is the only acceptable one to me&#8230; I just think they&#8217;re cool and classy as far as vans go. Unfortunately, after doing some craigslist searching and then some googling, I found out that Manual transmission Previas are very rare. That was my other requirement, there was no way I could stand an automatic car.<\/p>\n<p>So, I gave up hope on a 5 Speed Previa, and started searching far and near for my next candidate, an older 4&#215;4 Toyota. Either a pick-up or a 4runner. I scoured craigslist for weeks, and looked at a handful in person. There was always something wrong, either they were too out of shape and rusted, had very high mileage, or\u00a0<em>way<\/em> overpriced (some of these 4&#215;4 owners really think their 180k miles 1984 Toyota is worth 6k),\u00a0etc.<\/p>\n<p>I was getting tired of constantly searching for a 4&#215;4, so yesterday evening I decided to try looking for a Previa again. The listing at the top was a &#8217;91 Toyota Previa, and when I clicked it I was excited to find out that it was actually a <strong>5 speed<\/strong>. I grabbed my phone and called the guy, after giving him an inquisition about the details on the car, I eventually decided to go for it. I asked him to drive down.<\/p>\n<p>Body wise, the car was a little bit more beat up than I imagined but I didn&#8217;t really care. It drove and handled fine. After the test drive, we heard a sound that was initially passed off as a nearby sprinkler. Upon inspecting the floor, however, it was gravely obvious that there was a big leak in one of the coolant hoses. We were able to find out the location of the leak, it was coming from a steel coolant pipe at an elbow. Despite the leak, I still decided to buy it.<\/p>\n<p>Some negotiating and ultimately $1250 later, I had this round thing sitting in front of my house.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-209\" title=\"previa\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Paint is oxidized on the roof and there&#8217;s a couple big dents on the rear hatch, which I think I can push out&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>This morning I tried to fix the leak. It was either going to be the clamp holding on the coolant hose at the elbow, or the actual elbow is leaking. I bought a new c-clamp and tightened it down, started the car&#8230; and after a few minutes the leak started pouring out again.<\/p>\n<p>No good, I decided to skip this step for now and handle the next item on the list &#8211; smog. The engine temperature actually started rising as I was driving, but luckily there was a gas station at the next block. All the coolant actually leaked away, but after topping it off with some water, the temperatures remained steady.<\/p>\n<p>Once the smog test was over, the car failed. This definitely had me down, and I even impulsively put the car back for sale when I got home. I had some free time, so I drove it over to a nearby auto shop just to have a second opinion on the coolant leak.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-210\" title=\"previa2\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa2-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa2-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previa2.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A bit of a rough start when your car is on a lift on the first day of ownership.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was identified to be the actual coolant pipe that was leaking. The welds around the elbow were rusted beyond repair. The general condition of the undercarriage wasn&#8217;t bad, but the exhaust system stood out since all the bolts on it were completely rusted to the flanges.<\/p>\n<p>I went back home, grabbed some tools, and journeyed to the local Pick &#8216;N Pull junkyard.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previajunkyard.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-211\" title=\"previajunkyard\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previajunkyard-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previajunkyard-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previajunkyard.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Donor vehicle found.<\/p>\n<p>Some dirty wrenching later while rolling in coolant fluid that was splashing everywhere, I pulled off the pipe.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coolantpipe.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-208\" title=\"coolantpipe\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coolantpipe-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coolantpipe-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coolantpipe.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a view of what it looked like underneath, that gap is where the pipe went.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previaunder.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-212\" title=\"previaunder\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previaunder-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previaunder-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previaunder.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I then dropped off the Previa to the auto shop to have the pipe replaced and also to change out the Alternator and Power Steering belts.
