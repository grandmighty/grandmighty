I was pretty apprehensive when it finally came time to install the spoiler, because I would&#8217;ve been back to square one if something didn&#8217;t go right. Thankfully, you can almost always count on OEM fitment. <\/p>\n<p>Alas, my car is finally ready for the roads again and my compunctions mollified.
