After getting my bike <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2011\/08\/the-darkside-is-better\/\">street-ready<\/a>, the first ride I did was through the Santa Cruz mountains. By the end of it, I rode about 150 miles of twisties&#8230; and throughout the day, there was one\u00a0headache &#8211; literally.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2010\/10\/x-lite-x-802\/\">X-Lite<\/a>&#8216;s\u00a0shell size and shape did not conform to my head properly, it was too small. After about 30 minutes of riding with the helmet on, severe headache and pressure would\u00a0ensue\u00a0like clockwork. I remember my ear felt like it was going to explode at the peak of it. Thankfully there were breaks in the ride at intervals, otherwise I might have had an aneurysm. As soon as I got that lid off my head, relief kicked in almost instantly. This problem with the helmet was not previously apparent to me, mainly because I only rode with it on in brief sessions.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, I vowed to find a solution immediately. There was no way I would go through with that torture again. It just goes to show how crucial finding a good-fitting helmet is. While a helmet needs to be tight and snug, it&#8217;s shape must also conform to the shape of your head and not cause pressure points &#8211; otherwise, you might go through the same experience I had.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, I decided to go with another <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2010\/06\/agv-gp-tech-and-alpinestars-gp-pro\/\">AGV GP-Tech<\/a>, this time without the fanboy-ism (which is why I sold the first AGV) and in a solid, Mono Black color. I remembered how great that helmet had fit me, so might as well go with what&#8217;s tried and true.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agv.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2658\" title=\"agv\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agv-600x802.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"802\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agv-600x802.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agv.jpg 748w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvgptech.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvgptech-600x447.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"agvgptech\" width=\"600\" height=\"447\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2659\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvgptech-600x447.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvgptech-900x670.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvgptech.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvhelmet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvhelmet-600x431.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"agvhelmet\" width=\"600\" height=\"431\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2660\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvhelmet-600x431.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvhelmet-900x647.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/agvhelmet.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/gptechback.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/gptechback-600x425.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"gptechback\" width=\"600\" height=\"425\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2661\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/gptechback-600x425.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/gptechback-900x638.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/gptechback.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Superb quality and finish, I love this lid.
