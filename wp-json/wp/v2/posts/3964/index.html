The key importance here is the fitment. <\/p>\n<p>By fitment, I&#8217;m not talking about slamming a car with wheels that poke out. Nor am I talking about sunken wheels with large wheel gaps.

I will admit to finding the task of dialing in the ride height laborious and tedious. Unfortunately, there is no way around it. Accept what needs to be done and get busy. I had to jack up the car and take the wheels on and off over a dozen times before all 4 corners were properly set. <\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, this is what the fronts looked like when the car was first placed back down on the ground. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/slammed.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/slammed-620x929.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"slammed\" width=\"620\" height=\"929\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3965\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/slammed-620x929.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/slammed.jpg 667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/toolow.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/toolow-620x413.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"toolow\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3966\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/toolow-620x413.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/toolow-800x533.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/toolow.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>WAY TOO LOW.<\/strong><\/em> I don&#8217;t see how anyone could prefer that kind of ride height. All the kids nowadays are engaged in a competition to see who can have the lowest and most unusable car. I can state this with certainty: sooner or later, every one of these people will grow up and move past their ways. It is perfectly excusable to go for this style if you&#8217;re in your teens or early 20&#8217;s. Just have fun but remember not to try too hard&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I was eventually able to complete all the grunt work and the car was sitting at my approved height &#8211; a touch under 25&#8243; floor-to-fender all around. I probably raised the fronts up a good inch to inch and a half from its initial setup before I was content. The rears sit under 25&#8243; when there is a full tank of gas (I forgot how big the tank was, it ate up nearly $70 worth of gas to fill).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/frontrideheight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/frontrideheight-620x929.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"frontrideheight\" width=\"620\" height=\"929\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3967\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/frontrideheight-620x929.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/frontrideheight.jpg 667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/rearrideheight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/rearrideheight-620x929.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"rearrideheight\" width=\"620\" height=\"929\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3968\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/rearrideheight-620x929.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/rearrideheight.jpg 667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Much better. <strong>Purposeful function begets true beauty<\/strong>. I only drove the car around town briefly, but so far, there has been no issues with rubbing. I can roll over railroad tracks with ease, and I don&#8217;t have to block traffic to slow down for them. Best of all, I can drive the car as it was designed to be driven. It is blasphemous to &#8220;stance&#8221; out a sports car like the RX-7 and render it into a handicapped poser-mobile. I&#8217;m going to hold my tongue on the social commentary, as I can go on and on about this topic. I&#8217;ll save it for another post :-)<\/p>\n<p>The XD9&#8217;s are 18&#215;10&#8243; all around with +18 offset in the rear and +38 in the front. The tires are Federal RS-R&#8217;s in 255\/35\/18.
