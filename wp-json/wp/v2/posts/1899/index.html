While I may have shown enthusiasm when I first bought this car, because it did look solid initially, I soon discovered that things were far from ideal. As I was working on the car, more and more negatives became unveiled. I took a peek down the front side of the engine, and saw that it was covered with a patina of oil. This is most likely the source of the oil found on the oil pan and transmission. It could be from the valve cover leaking over time. Regardless, a major seal overhaul job will need to be done, which means a full timing belt service&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In addition, returning the car&#8217;s body back into shape was not going to be as easy as I hoped. There are dings, which are all very minor, but the fact that they are spread around the car makes repair difficult. Both the front and rear bumpers needed work. The front had 2 dents in it from the license plate bracket, and the rear bumper looked like it was bumped into before on the driver&#8217;s side corner. The only real solution is a full repaint. It was a hard, yet necessary decision to make.<\/p>\n<p>I certainly felt\u00a0disappointed\u00a0when problems kept accumulating, but there&#8217;s no turning back. The car is currently at the body shop, and in the meantime I can only wait and hope for the best.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to post this update earlier, however, a couple demanding choices needed to be made and thought through, which I&#8217;ll get into momentarily.
