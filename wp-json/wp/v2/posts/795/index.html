It may seem weird that I&#8217;m counting each Coyote Hills ride, but it&#8217;s a good tally for myself. I figured since my bicycle was nowhere cheap, I need to recoop some of that investment&#8230; and the more rides I can log, the more money returned.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/coyotehillsrest.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-796\" title=\"coyotehillsrest\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/coyotehillsrest-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/coyotehillsrest-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/coyotehillsrest.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday, I ended up joining a group motorcycle ride in the morning.
