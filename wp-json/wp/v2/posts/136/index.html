Supposedly, Cold-Eeze should reduce the duration of the common cold by &#8220;42%.&#8221; It works by using a special type of zinc that works homeopathically. When you dissolve the lozenges, the zinc attracts the rhinoviruses like a magnet would with metallics shreds. While, in theory, it appears to be functional&#8230; my first hand basis proved contrary. My cold started last Friday, and by Sunday I had a moment where I felt nearly normal, which is what lead me to believe that the Cold-Eeze really worked. Unfortunately, by Monday I was back to feeling down. From what I recall, the general cycle of the colds I get start with a sore throat, which moves onto fatigue and a fever. After a period of that, a stage of clogged sinuses, a runny nose, and coughing ensues. On average, I&#8217;d say colds last about a week for me&#8230; well it&#8217;s day 6 for me and I still don&#8217;t feel well, so a 42% reduction my ass.<\/p>\n<p>Enough about that, food is always a good topic to revert to. I had some lunch at this place yesterday&#8230; I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s my favorite local Chinese restaurant of this type. The dishes have good ingredients and aren&#8217;t rushed or filthy greasy like most other places.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/darda.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-137\" title=\"darda\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/darda-590x545.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"545\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/darda-590x545.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/darda.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Today, after work I went over to Moto Cafe in Sunnyvale. They surprisingly had a Pearl White Monoposto seat cowl in stock, and the parts guy was cool enough to give me a discount and wait for me after closing. The reason why I want the cowl is because my bike currently has a regular seat on the back, but no passenger pegs. I don&#8217;t see how anyone would be particularly comfortable back there anyway.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/motocafe.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-139\" title=\"motocafe\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/motocafe-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/motocafe-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/motocafe.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This should look good&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/monoposto.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-138\" title=\"monoposto\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/monoposto-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/monoposto-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/monoposto.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just to recap&#8230; when I expressed optimism regarding the Cold-Eeze lozenges in an earlier post, I now think they&#8217;re utterly useless.
