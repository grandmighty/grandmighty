So the waiting continues&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>There wasn&#8217;t much I could do last weekend. It pains me because I would love to steam forward and have the car back on its wheels. The weekends are also the only days I can find time to actually get things done, which incentivizes my productivity. The slower pace gives me breathing room, but I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;m not accustomed to sitting so idly. <\/p>\n<p>I ended up just vacuuming the interior and throwing in my like-new OEM RZ floormats, which gave me a tiny sense of accomplishment. I&#8217;m not sure if these are specific to the RZ models only, I only know they&#8217;re offered exclusively overseas. These were definitely an impulse buy, a byproduct of habitual late-night classifieds cruising. Since my custom berber floormats were still mint and hardly used, I will save them as spares. The OEM mats are better quality and come with a nice, metal RX-7 plaque. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/jdmfloormats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/jdmfloormats-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"jdmfloormats\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4994\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/jdmfloormats-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/jdmfloormats-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/jdmfloormats.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/99floormats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/99floormats-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"99floormats\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4992\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/99floormats-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/99floormats-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/99floormats.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The styling may not be for everyone, but I like the uniqueness. While they are made for RHD cars, fitment was surprisingly good. The only issue I noticed was that the driver-side mat ran up the dead pedal slightly more than before. <\/p>\n<p>I probably should have called it a day and grabbed a beer after &#8220;installing&#8221; the floormats. However, the trooper in me still had energy so I decided to install a reinforcement brace Sake Bomb Garage gave me for their <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2013\/05\/rear-fire-extinguisher\/\">Rear Fire Extinguisher Bracket<\/a> next. The mount flexed and had more movement than I liked. After drilling a hole into the bracket, the added brace helped to triangulate and stiffen the lower section and keep the floor&#8217;s sheet metal from flexing. Kudos to Sake Bomb Garage&#8217;s customer service for taking the time to follow-up with this and actually producing a remedy. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/rearextinguisherbrace.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/rearextinguisherbrace-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"rearextinguisherbrace\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4995\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/rearextinguisherbrace-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/rearextinguisherbrace-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/rearextinguisherbrace.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, I added Dynamat to the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2013\/09\/morel-maximo-speakers-regulator-maintenance\/\">Speaker Adapters <\/a> in an effort to seal them up better and reduce the potential for vibration. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dynamat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dynamat-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"dynamat\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4993\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dynamat-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dynamat-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dynamat.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I limited my application to only the adapters.
