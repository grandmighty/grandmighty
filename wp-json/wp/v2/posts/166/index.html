They&#8217;re cheap ($100), have good glass, and are simple. Sure, they may not have a very strong construction (plastic body) or any zoom&#8230; but they produce the results and I think that&#8217;s most important. I&#8217;m giving this example because I think it speaks on my\u00a0philosophy with camera bodies as well.<\/p>\n<p>The 550D I decided on is in the Rebel entry-level family of Canon DSLRs. Why didn&#8217;t I buy a more expensive camera like a 7D? Because the extra money in that camera are for features I don&#8217;t need. I consider myself as a hobbyist photographer, and I definitely don&#8217;t need things like weather-sealing or 18,000+ ISO capabilities. Most importantly of all, DSLRs nowadays are all capable of producing the same or similar level of photos. A Nikon D40 (which can be found for ~$300 used) can take pictures that are as good as the much more expensive D90&#8217;s. It really all comes down to how a picture is set up and the skillfulness of the person responsible behind the camera. It is not entirely\u00a0dependent\u00a0on who has the biggest lens. If you are a professional photographer and shoot sports or wildlife, then that&#8217;s one instance where the features of more expensive cameras are qualified. Things like lenses and flashes are more important than the body in my opinion.<\/p>\n<p>Photography still isn&#8217;t a cheap thing to get into, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be outrageously expensive either.<\/p>\n<p>You could also argue, why not just get good a point and shoot like a Canon S90 or Panasonic LX3? While they are capable of taking superb images, I still feel that the overall potential of DSLRs outweigh the portability of point and shoots. DOF is something that is amiss with pocket cameras, for example, I haven&#8217;t seen one that can stop down and produce nice bokeh equivalent to that of a SLR.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, if I&#8217;m travelling&#8230; my mentality (and my lazy self) is I would rather just use a cellphone to document pictures if the pictures aren&#8217;t meant to be serious. While a point and shoot is small, it&#8217;s still another item on the list that you have to bring and carry. If I want to take more thought out pictures, then of course it will be worth it to lug a DSLR.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Currently, through my 4 years history with photography, I&#8217;ve only ever owned 50mm prime lenses and nothing else.
