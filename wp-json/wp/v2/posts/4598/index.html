I was confident in their fitment offset and width wise, because I have that down to a science with this car. The whole stepping down to 17&#8243; thing, however, garnered some anticipation. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d reckon that the majority of RX-7s with wheels go for 18&#8243;. For the cars that did have 17&#8243; wheels, I could hardly find any proper or good looking example. It&#8217;s important to note that wheels must work holistically with the car. All of the other variables must be thoroughly accounted for to pull off a successful setup: ride height, offset, width, tire choice (all-seasons or budget brands need not apply), etc. <\/p>\n<p>There was no choice but to take the initiative on this one. Once I put the wheels on the car, any trace of apprehension or doubt went out the door &#8211; I took a step back and knew I was looking at my grail setup. I invested heavily to procure, piece together, and refinish this specific set of RegaMasters, so I&#8217;m delighted that it paid off. This has affirmed and solidified my thinking that 17&#8243; wheels are more ideal for a stock body RX-7. <\/p>\n<p>I did have to spend a weekend correcting the ride height, I ended up dropping all four corners slightly to a height of 24-3\/4&#8243; from floor to fender. This closed up the wheel gap and is what I think is optimal, it strikes a balance between form and function. The front end of the car was suspiciously higher than before after the single turbo conversion&#8230; especially the passenger (turbo) side. <\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of the rear wheels. I love the period-correct and understated look of RegaMasters. I&#8217;m using a set of Project Kics R40 REVO lugnuts in Neo-Chro. I think this is the fourth time I&#8217;ve bought these particular lugnuts, they&#8217;ve become a staple of mine, more or less. I even tried looking for an alternative set, but wasn&#8217;t able to find anything as intriguing. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/desmondregamaster.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/desmondregamaster-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"desmondregamaster\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4599\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/desmondregamaster-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/desmondregamaster-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/desmondregamaster.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On one of the front wheels, the paint started to crack around the lugnut holes when tightened down. I had to bring this wheel back to Wheel Techniques to fix, for fear of the paint cracking further. They were able to sand and bevel the lugnut seat areas. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, here&#8217;s a full picture of the RX-7 with the wheels mounted. I realize that I don&#8217;t have many shots of the car as a whole, most of what I have are up-close of parts. This will have to change once I can get the car detailed and finalized. If any competent photographer is reading this and wants to assist, let me know! I&#8217;ve become extremely lazy with pictures. As you can see in the below, I simply pulled the car out in front of my house and snapped away. Regarding the glare, I wasn&#8217;t patient enough to wait for the sun to go down more. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/rx7r2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/rx7r2-777x494.jpg\" alt=\"rx7r2\" width=\"777\" height=\"494\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4600\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/rx7r2-777x494.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/rx7r2-960x611.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/rx7r2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was quite the momentous occasion when I mounted on the RegaMasters.
