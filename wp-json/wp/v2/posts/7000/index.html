Keep them coming! I will eventually address all of them when I get enough of a bundle. One question in particular has touched a subject that I&#8217;ve been meaning to deliberate on for the longest time, and will now take the opportunity to do so.<\/p>\n<p>From &#8220;Andrew L&#8221;:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Besides your RX-7, and 240sx, what is the next car you see yourself building, something that you won&#8217;t sell, and plan on keeping foreverrrrrrr.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Well, Andrew, I like the tacit projection in your question. I think an obvious pattern has emerged from my history. I&#8217;ve indulged in my fickle nature over the years by constantly rotating through different projects. This has helped keep my mind and my hands occupied, as I&#8217;m not usually the type to appreciate inactivity. Consequently, I have now amassed enough knowledge and experience to reach a level of deep understanding. An understanding in not only the mechanical know-how of my own skills, but also in the various processes involved as a whole, including the solicitation of the right craftsmen when outsourcing is required.<\/p>\n<p>Given my current state of confidence and my propensity to want to build, the bar is set quite high for my next choice in a project. Choosing to do something simple with basic bolt-ons would be too easy and a waste of what I really want to achieve. I&#8217;ve always reveled in being unique by doing work that is truly at a greater standard and magnitude. Whatever is next, I am ready to dig even deeper.<\/p>\n<p>My priority right now is to evolve my RX-7 into its final stages. While I may have said it&#8217;s &#8220;done&#8221; at some point in the recent past, truthfully, there&#8217;s still more to do. And then probably more after that. Each step, however, inches me closer to my desired vision. And at the very least &#8211; I am close.<\/p>\n<p>Now, going back to the question. After busying myself with this car hobby for so long, it has shaped and altered my perspectives. Therefore, I will respond by sharing an eclectic wish list of cars, which was iteratively developed through careful consideration. The blunt fact is there are not many economically feasible cars that I truly want, which I&#8217;ve repeated frequently in the past&#8230; to the point where this statement can serve as a motif for this entire website. For something out-of-the-box, I find myself wanting choices that have starting price tags north of $180k. This probably explains why I keep finding myself in older (especially 90&#8217;s era) cars that I can tinker with and mold myself. Anyway, what I would like to build as the next step in my journey is an all-out track machine. Since a track build is typically ground-up and comprehensive, it would be the perfect medium to exploit the full potential of creativity. <\/p>\n<p>These are my choices for such a project. Ideally, I would like to find a straight body roller to start with. These are all classic cars because I personally think frankensteining old with new is awesome. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jaguar (XKE) E-Type Coupe<\/li>\n<li>1968 Dodge Charger<\/li>\n<li>De Tomaso Mangusta<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve grown to adore the E-Type and remark it as one of the most beautiful cars, if not THE most beautiful, of all time. I&#8217;ve dreamed of doing a rotisserie rebuild with inspirations from the Lightweight E-Type. I was quite surprised when I came across the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.speedhunters.com\/2016\/09\/project-purist-jaguar-e-type-built-drift\/\">Speedhunters article<\/a> in September about the 2 U.K. brothers who 1JZ swapped a barn-find E-Type. Their car followed a similar path to my own aspirations and provided valuable insight on the process. A coupe E-Type would be preferable.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793-777x513.jpg\" alt=\"dsc_3271-edit-1200x793\" width=\"777\" height=\"513\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7004\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793-777x513.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793-768x508.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793-960x634.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793-200x132.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793-400x264.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_3271-Edit-1200x793.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"dsc_0272-edit-1200x800\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7003\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800-768x512.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800-200x133.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800-400x267.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_0272-Edit-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Dodge Charger is another car that I found myself drawn to for inexplicable reasons.

Honestly, the choice in my next project comes down to what can be found and what is most realistically attainable. Finding a Mangusta is unlikely, but it&#8217;s a super cool car. I&#8217;m not going to lie, this is the one car on the list that anchored itself into my radar via a movie. The Mangusta makes brief appearances in <em>Kill Bill: Vol. 2<\/em> and made me wonder what the hell it was at the time. <\/p>\n<p>Being from the United States, I would love to take advantage of domestic resources and leverage the relative abundance of the Charger, which is the choice that I&#8217;m leaning towards the most at the moment. But who knows, my styles and perspectives are always changing. And honestly, I&#8217;m at a point in my life where time is extremely limited and other priorities are looming. If fortune prevails, I will be able to undertake a project of this depth. Or, it may never come to fruition and I will have to take a step back from the fold. The investment of resources required is significant, so the planning is more difficult and not something I can just jump into with careless freedom. <\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m finding myself content with the RX-7 and want to focus on delivering its final form. As for the 240sx, I would like to keep it around as a beater. It&#8217;s cheap, an overall good car, and, well&#8230; I already bought it. &#8220;Street&#8221; flavored projects have dominated my portfolio thus far and I want to avoid repeating what I already know. My RX-7 serves as my total accumulation in that category and is the closing comment to that chapter. <em>IF<\/em> I somehow have the capacity to take on another street project, my eyes are set on a Guards Red Porsche 964 C2 with metal (NON-riveted) Turbo flares, <a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/2011\/09\/rough-world-porsche\/\">like this<\/a>. Back in 2011 when I made that post, I looked seriously at C2 964s but unfortunately lacked the position to pull the trigger on one. I wish I could have, because we are now all aware of the proliferation of air-cooled 911 values. <\/p>\n<p>Anyway, thank you Andrew for sending in your question and I hope this long-winded post answers it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First off, thanks to the few who have sent in questions from the Ask Me Anything post so far.
