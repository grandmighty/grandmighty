Frankly speaking, I was never really motivated to do so because I didn&#8217;t feel connected with where I was living. The extent of my motivation was when I <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2011\/01\/workspace-part-1\/\">went to OfficeMax and bought a desk<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Now that I was moving, I felt compelled to devote much needed attention to my room. I updated my bed to something a normal adult should sleep in: a full-size mattress on an Ikea Malm bed frame + nightstand with Ikea Sultan Laxeby slats. This bed frame combo was love at first sight. I loved the contemporary simplicity of its design and the low-slung profile. Best of all, in character with Ikea, it was affordable. Also, after using the same alarm clock since 1997, I finally bought myself a new one&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/ikeamalm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3655\" title=\"ikeamalm\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/ikeamalm-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/ikeamalm-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/ikeamalm-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/ikeamalm.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For my desk and &#8220;office&#8221;, I chose an Ikea Galant table with chrome A-legs and black wood top.

Preferably, to set the desk height, you want to sit in the chair upright with your arms hanging naturally and your elbow at a 90 degree angle.<\/p>\n<p>People like to knock Ikea, but for the best bang for the buck, they are hard to beat. I agree that many of their items are rubbish, you just have to know what you&#8217;re looking for and be wary of their low-end lines. My bed and desk are sturdy and well designed. I personally think my room&#8217;s arrangement is pimp and it didn&#8217;t break the bank. Ballin&#8217; on a budget at its finest. I could just as easily go to a &#8220;name brand&#8221; furniture store and spend hundreds more, then end up with something that looks like it belongs in a retirement home. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Scandinavian style of modernism and functionalism.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not quite done with my room yet. I still need a rug and file cabinet.
