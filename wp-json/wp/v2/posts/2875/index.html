The reason why I decided to part ways with the car is clear &#8211; and not a new one. Like my other cars, I did not make enough use of it. If something does not have immediate purpose or a potential for utilization, I break my attachment with it and move on. This is not to say I didn&#8217;t drive the Miata at all, I used it for occasional commuting. The principal motive behind my sale stems from a vast contradiction of a personal philosophy I imposed at the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2011\/03\/project-x\/\">onset of this project<\/a>. I stated with conviction how owning a fancy, name-brand car was unimportant. While my intentions may have been acceptable, I am now taking an opposite stance on this. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/projectroadster.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/projectroadster-600x399.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"projectroadster\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2876\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/projectroadster-600x399.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/projectroadster.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Owning a &#8220;normal&#8221; car, whether or not if it blends in with the crowd, is what I want. Driving around in the Miata, no matter how done up, was still driving around in a Miata. I thought I wanted a basic and raw car, spartan in every aspect. The Miata was exactly this, it was stiff, simplistic, and loud. Hence why I predominantly opted to drive in the refined and smooth convenience of the Prius. The nature of the Miata and how I built it would have made sense if I tracked the car, but realistically, I was never going to. This put the Miata in the same group as all my previous cars: filled with trinkets and bells &#038; whistles, but served no significant function for me. At least with my bike, I fully plan on using it at the track. <\/p>\n<p>All of this might be the old man in me talking, but I have to face it, it&#8217;s time to grow up. Pouring in copious amounts of money and <em>time<\/em> with my <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2010\/12\/modified-feature\/\">old RX-7<\/a> was enough. Doing it all over again with the Miata made it doubly stupid. I had ideas of how I wanted the Miata to be, and my stubborn ways forced me to persevere until my vision was realized. Simply said, modding a car is POINTLESS. I sound like a broken record-player now. I offloaded the Miata at a cheap price and lost a lot of money. This is the price I will have to pay, and is also a final lesson for me. <\/p>\n<p>Up until now, all my cars have been Japanese and from the 90&#8217;s. I am breaking out of this horrid tradition and going with something newer and better. This way, I won&#8217;t be tempted to change out every single part and component on the vehicle. I really feel like I just came out of rehab and kicked a meth addiction or something. Yes, modding cars is a negative addiction and an expensive one too. I am no longer a child, so the moment beckons to add sophistication and maturation into my life. <\/p>\n<p>So long Miata &#8211; yet another unnecessary car project &#8211; it was fun in a sadistic sort of way. You took away my money. You took away my time. And you added years worth of undue stress. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Prelude: this post.
