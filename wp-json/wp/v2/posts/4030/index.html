Satisfied with the progress made thus far and how the car sits today, I would like to take a moment to reflect. <\/p>\n<p>Choosing the path that I did with the RX-7 was a major decision and ultimately an irreversible one. This was going to be a project in every sense of the word. Anyone who has undertaken and experienced cars in the same manner that I have will be able to relate. <\/p>\n<p>For example, on the rare occasion I see a properly executed and well-equipped car, I am able to truly appreciate the work and money invested. I especially favor the clean yet understated machines. To an untrained eye, they may simply look like a &#8220;slightly&#8221; modded car&#8230; but for those that know, there is far more to it than that. On the flip-side, the flashier, attention grabbing cars are more often than not to be ones with inferior workmanship and motive. <\/p>\n<p>With that said, let me cut to the chase and be blunt here. Including the price of the car itself, I have enough invested to buy a C6 ZO6 or E92 M3 (both of which are great options). So I&#8217;ve been asked, why didn&#8217;t I just do that? Why dump all this money and exert so much effort into an old Mazda? Let me ask you this, why be average? <\/p>\n<p>To try and rationalize: after much introspection, I concluded that I&#8217;m not the type of person who can get into a car &#8211; and be done with it. So-called &#8220;enthusiasts&#8221; are a dime a dozen. Anyone can open their wallet, buy a car, then masquerade as a guru. Standing in parking lots and spewing facts that you found on Wikipedia about your fancy Lotus just doesn&#8217;t cut it. You earn your stripes from the school of hard knocks, having the money is only half of the equation. Now, I&#8217;m not trying to downplay buying a high-end or new sports car, because I have nothing against that. My point is more original and less mainstream choices are viable. The easy way is not always the funnest.  <\/p>\n<p>I was never much of an artist on paper or canvas, but I&#8217;d like to think that I have a creative mind. Cars provide me a medium for expression and I also see them as complex puzzle. This is why I decided to follow the path less traveled and went back to the RX-7. I am quite proud to be able to know that I personally uplifted this car at the end of it all. Furthermore, I am funding everything out of my own pocket. This RX-7 is truly my baby and an achievement to me, and I can wholeheartedly back that. I know it&#8217;s just an old Mazda, but I prefer the subtlety anyway &#8211; it offers better and more candid rewards.<\/p>\n<p>This is a project that I&#8217;ve sunk myself so deep into that a point of return no longer exists. I&#8217;m okay with that, I want to test my perseverance. Steadfastness and vision underpin quality work.
