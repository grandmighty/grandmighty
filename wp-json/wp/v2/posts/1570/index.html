Not to mention a colossal waste of time.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny since I had always refrained from using MySpace because I thought it stupid, yet\u00a0hypocritically\u00a0I caved in to the whole Facebook revolution. More or less recently, my interest and activity with Facebook has been on a steady decline. I used to think it was reasonable to maintain a measure of utility by keeping my account active. But not anymore. I&#8217;ve grown an almost addictive habit of checking Facebook daily, which accounts for unnecessary lost time and productivity. I finally determined the negatives were not worth dealing with for the few and dispensable positives. There&#8217;s an infinite amount of things that are better to do than go on Facebook, and I&#8217;ll tell you why.<\/p>\n<p>The underlying basis of Facebook revolves around pretension and conceit. Calling it a &#8220;social network&#8221; site is not entirely transparent nor authentic. The notion of networking has been contorted and\u00a0transmogrified\u00a0into something lost of its original intent.\u00a0All I see when I go on Facebook is a clutter of absolutely useless information. No one really cares or should care about 99% (this is entirely factual) of the stuff others post.<\/p>\n<p>I realized there was a fundamental fault with Facebook after I saw a pattern of constantly hiding different people from my news feed.<\/p>\n<p>Made a status update complaining about a trivial inconvenience? Shared a picture of a meal you should be consuming rather than uploading onto the internet? Checked-in to a place as proof to everyone you live an outgoing life? Added 100 more friends that you never met or vaguely even know (but promotes your e-popularity)? Get invited to an event that you will not attend or remotely care about? Expressed your enthusiasm for something that&#8217;s quite obviously far more exciting for yourself than anyone else? THE IMMENSITY OF THE FUCK I DO NOT GIVE.\u00a0People are too obsessed with inflating their own image. It&#8217;s sad.<\/p>\n<p>Worst of all is the regret that I shamefully participated in some of these egocentric activities. Oh, the allure and inveiglement Facebook possesses.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of mindlessly checking Facebook everyday, I can hopefully divert attention to actually living life instead of reading about it.\u00a0If I need to contact someone, I may do so with other means, and vice versa. If not, then I probably don&#8217;t need to talk to you in the first place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook:\u00a0the ultimate ego boosting tool of the 21st century.
