Oh well, that&#8217;s not going to stop me from trying again and again. I&#8217;ll probably put up another forum a few months after this one invariably fails, too.<\/p>\n<p>After going through a life cycle of feeling enthusiastic and energized to dismissive and apathetic, I&#8217;ve resolved to close down the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2013\/12\/7tuned-com\/\">7TUNED Forums<\/a>. It was a valiant effort and I invested a fair amount of work into it, but ultimately, 7TUNED was an exercise in futility. It carried commendable momentum in the beginning stages. Unfortunately, it reached its peak and plateaued shortly after. The justification and potential for another RX-7 centric forum just isn&#8217;t there. I&#8217;ll suck up my ego and admit it. The combination of a minority\u00a0car segment with the decline of major forums in general proved fateful. No matter how hard I tried to spin a new-age concept to 7TUNED with modern software and an appealing design, people are reluctant to adopt change. RX7Club.com, no matter how stale it has become, is too established to overthrow.<\/p>\n<p>Automotive forums just are not like they used to be &#8211; actual communities backed with helpful and insightful members.\u00a0Now the crowd leverages social media like Facebook and Instagram, which I believe is a shame and a sign of apathy. I still think a discussion forum is the prime platform to truly compliment the automotive genre, with its inherent technical and media oriented subject matters. There is little community aspect to simply clicking a like button on social media. Having people who are interested in a common topic and are willing to type paragraphs to each other strikes\u00a0the best balance, in my opinion.<\/p>\n<p>This is why I choose to continue to persevere with another forum. Although I did my best to keep 7TUNED as clutter free as possible,\u00a0my sights were set too high overall. If I&#8217;m going to kill off 7TUNED, I figured it&#8217;d make sense to throw up a quick forum here on Grand Mighty instead. The idea is to keep the forum as simple as possible&#8230; when in doubt, go back to the basics. I want its purpose to be niche and close-grouped. I&#8217;m assuming people who visit Grand Mighty are like minded individuals, and it&#8217;d be a great opportunity to interact with them more than just through the comments section of my posts.<\/p>\n<p>Long story short, to anyone reading this post, give the new Forum a try&#8230; I promise it&#8217;s about as simple as a discussion board can get. Even if you don&#8217;t really feel like it, I would appreciate it if you just humor me on this idea and join, otherwise I&#8217;ll probably be in there talking to myself&#8230; no big deal.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/forum\/\">Grand Mighty Forum<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve lost count, but this seems like it will be my third Forum try during my tenure on this website.
