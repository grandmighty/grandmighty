That dish is filled with various seafood (the meat of KINGS) like big ass shrimps, calamari, and stuff I don&#8217;t even know but is amazing. All the noodles are THICK and HANDMADE IN THE USA from flour, a.k.a. the ONLY kind of noodles you should ever eat.<\/p>\n<p>MY GOD.<\/p>\n<p>I felt like a drug addict mainlining pure-grade heroin (I&#8217;m exaggerating a bit).<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is still a catch. While my gums around the lower extraction areas are now healed enough where I can chew, I have to be aware of the holes. This means I have to use a special syringe and flush out food until they close up more (another week). The nurse that &#8220;test drove&#8221; the syringe for me shoved it pretty damn far into one of the holes&#8230; not a fun feeling.<\/p>\n<p>At least I got my favorite noodle soup for the maiden meal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>= heaven in my mouth.
