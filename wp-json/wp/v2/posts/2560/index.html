These are OEM (what else?) and mount conveniently to pre-drilled holes on the car. The rears go on in minutes, but in a flash of OCD, I ended up spending almost an hour on the passenger side front mudflap. I kept trying variations of methods and angles to mount it in a way that would remove any gaps between the body. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m spending the little youth I have left by obsessing over the minutia of a couple mm&#8217;s. After all that, I later discovered that the front tires would pull out the top tabs of the front mudguards when turning. I had to modify the way they mounted and do some cutting to gain clearance. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/miatamudguards.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/miatamudguards-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"miatamudguards\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2561\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/miatamudguards-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/miatamudguards-900x675.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/miatamudguards.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/mudflap.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/mudflap-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"mudflap\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2562\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/mudflap-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/mudflap-900x675.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/mudflap.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Some people might hate them, but I think these mudguards compliment the car perfectly, especially because mine is black.
