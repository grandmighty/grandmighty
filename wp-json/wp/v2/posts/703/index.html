Ever since I sold the AGV GP-Tech, I&#8217;ve been on the hunt for the right lid&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The AGV was a nice helmet, but I didn&#8217;t like the graphics. I wanted something simpler this time, a solid white color. There are a lot of helmets out there that come in white, but I also wanted something a bit more unique. I liked the brief experience I had with a Shoei RF-1100, so I decided to go for another Shoei in the X-12 version. Unfortunately, after calling distributors, Shoei was some how\u00a0completely\u00a0out of white X-12&#8217;s in my size. This ended up being a process of waiting a couple of weeks, calling with no avail, waiting a couple more weeks&#8230; etc. My alternative was another AGV GP-Tech in white, but likewise it was impossible to source one.<\/p>\n<p>I was about to resort to my third choice, an Arai Corsair V which was much more readily available. I knew it was a good helmet, but I wasn&#8217;t entirely fond of its shape. Shortly before pulling the trigger on the Arai, I came across a less mainstream brand called X-lite. They&#8217;re popular in Europe and many racers wear them, but are not easily found in the US. I looked at the X-lite X-802 and decided this was finally the helmet I&#8217;ve been looking for all this time&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Buying it, however, also wasn&#8217;t that easy. I had to buy it from a German distributor, which was a bit of a gamble. Luckily they had what I needed in stock, and it was shipped fairly quickly. The actual shipping took a couple weeks, but I now finally have a helmet.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-704\" title=\"x802front\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802front-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802front-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802front.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/xlite802.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-706\" title=\"xlite802\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/xlite802-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/xlite802-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/xlite802.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802rear.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-705\" title=\"x802rear\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802rear-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802rear-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/x802rear.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The fit is a bit tight and this helmet does sit a bit closer to your face than others.
