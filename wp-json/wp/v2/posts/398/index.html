A lot of searches yielded results that were either sold already, or too high in price. I think I was too tight with my budget because I wanted a deal. I&#8217;ve been looking for either a 2007+ CBR600RR, or a 2006+ Yamaha R6. I came across an ad for a 2008 Silver CBR yesterday night, and called this morning to arrange a meeting. The bike was described to be &#8220;like new&#8221; and it felt like it was time to pull the trigger.<\/p>\n<p>I went to a family lunch gathering in the morning-afternoon in Millbrae, then made my way over to San Jose to check out the bike. When I called the seller to tell him I was on my way, he said there was another guy on his way to look at it as well&#8230; so that added a bit of stress and potentially reduced my bargaining leverage. Once I arrived, the CBR was still in his garage so that was a good sign. I checked it over, approved, and handed him the cash.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily for me, the person that looked at the bike before me offered him a price that was slightly lower than mine, but he accepted mine. Loading the bike into the Previa was a little difficult since the van was relatively high in the rear. Starting off from a grade to reduce the angle of the ramp definitely helped, in this case, we used the sidewalk.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful drive back home, here it is :)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/previatransport.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-400\" title=\"previatransport\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/previatransport-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/previatransport-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/previatransport.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/cbr600.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-399\" title=\"cbr600\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/cbr600-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/cbr600-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/cbr600.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The CBR rides noticeably smooth and silky. Starting off is much easier than the Ducati was (mainly because the 848 had a tall gearing that made first gear harder to get going). The brakes don&#8217;t grab as hard as the Ducati&#8217;s Brembos did. Overall, the bike is very nice and clean. Some scratches on the right side but nothing major. Mileage right now is at around 3640.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m ecstatic, should be an interesting and fun road ahead with this thing. It was the right choice to let go of the Ducati for this CBR&#8230; the Honda is much cheaper and easier on maintenance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been searching feverishly for a while now for a suitable middle-weight bike, and especially so since I sold the Ducati.
