Not only did I break the horn button, I also botched up the actual spokes of the wheel. Courtesy of Nardi, the wheel came new with a couple light scratches. So of course I attempted to buff it out, which only yielded even further micro scratches in the process. It was a losing game. It got to the point where I had to wetsand the spokes with 2000grit, and that&#8217;s about when I decided to throw in the towel. <\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t want to bother with it anymore, so I bought the same steering wheel again. Why not? Thanks to cheap knock-off companies using real Nardi horn buttons on their fake wheels, Nardi decided to bump up their prices. The horn button originally cost $40&#8230; now it sells for $100. Not exactly helpful for buyers of real Nardi wheels like me&#8230; Which is why it seemed more logical to just buy another wheel rather than cash out on a little button. <\/p>\n<p>Although the OMP suede wheel was perfectly good, I had made it a point to get this wood Nardi. I wanted a touch of class in a mostly uncivilized car. There&#8217;s a lot stacked against me for driving a cheap, Japanese, &#8220;tuner&#8221; car, so I need to do all I can to introduce a slightly higher level of refinement. <\/p>\n<p>3 wheels to achieve 1 result.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/steeringwheels.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/steeringwheels-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"steeringwheels\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2628\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/steeringwheels-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/steeringwheels-900x675.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/steeringwheels.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For Nardi #2, I literally had it installed from start to finish in under 10 minutes.
