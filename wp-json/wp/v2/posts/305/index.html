I had changed virtually everything I reasonably could, that was related with emissions, and the van still wasn&#8217;t passing. The only thing it was failing in was the 15mph NOx test. The maximum allowed was 1100, but it was measuring 1300. Close, but no cigar.<\/p>\n<p>The only options left that I knew of included cleaning out the EGR valve or playing with the timing, neither of which I wanted to do because the engine was running fine. I also didn&#8217;t want to drop anymore money on what seemed like a never ending ordeal.<\/p>\n<p>That meant it was time to get a little sly&#8230; I threw in some Fuel System Cleaner before the tank went completely empty. Then I drove the car around a good amount before the test &#8211; went on the highway for a bit and then climbed a large hill nearby to the smog place. The objective was to get the catalytic converter nice and hot, and up to operating temperature. Next, I pumped up all the tires to max pressure, and the rear drive tires were inflated to 6 psi over max. This should reduce the load on the engine during the dyno runs. Finally, it was time to bring the heat with this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/heet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-306\" title=\"heet\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/heet-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/heet-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/heet.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a gasoline line antifreeze, but what it really is is Methyl Alcohol. I ran the tank to below 1\/4 full, then poured in the bottle and took the test. The alcohol should burn cleaner and colder, and trick the sniffer.<\/p>\n<p>Well, it worked. Since the previous NOx readings were fairly close, I was only hoping that all these things would be enough to push it to borderline passing. The van not only passed, but it passed by a LONG shot.<\/p>\n<p>The HydroCarbon readings remained about the same as before, which were already good. The NOx readings, however, basically dropped by 1300&#8230; The 15mph test now measured a whole 22 for NOx. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s exactly realistic, but a pass is a pass :)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to attribute most of the success to the HEET, a secret weapon for smog. A cheap $2 bottle that&#8217;s a head ache saver.<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, I made my way over to the DMV to finally get the title transferred and registered under my name.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purchased Vehicle: $1250<\/li>\n<li>Smog Test (Failed): $31<\/li>\n<li>Coolant Leak Diagnosis: $10<\/li>\n<li>Coolant Pipe from Junkyard: $24 + $2 entrance fee<\/li>\n<li>Mobil 1 Oil: $27<\/li>\n<li>Oil Filter: $4<\/li>\n<li>Sea Foam: $9<\/li>\n<li>Wiper Blades: $28<\/li>\n<li>Bosch Upstream O2 Sensor: $78<\/li>\n<li>Bosch Downstream O2 Sensor: $50<\/li>\n<li>AC Delco Battery: $56<\/li>\n<li>Bumper Coating Paint: $4<\/li>\n<li>Work for Coolant Pipe and New Belts: $180<\/li>\n<li>NGK Iridium IX Spark Plugs: $29<\/li>\n<li>Direct-Fit Catalytic Converter: $154<\/li>\n<li>Magnaflow 5\u00d78 Race Muffler: $130<\/li>\n<li>BWD Spark Plug Wires: $49<\/li>\n<li>Floor Mats: $16<\/li>\n<li>Muffler Shop Work: $220<\/li>\n<li>Fuel System Cleaner: $8<\/li>\n<li>HEET Gas Antifreeze: $2<\/li>\n<li>Smog Test #3 (Pass): $20<\/li>\n<li>DMV Title Transfer Fee: $15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s finally time to tally everything up. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the van is now back to good running condition and the maintenance work is finished. The items listed in the tally all follow such a criteria: they must be related, by some degree, to restoring the van back to full operational status.<\/p>\n<p>SO, the sum total after the initial purchase price of $1250 is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>$2396<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Preferably, I wanted to only allocate $2000 flat to this van, so it went about $400 over budget. I agree that some items could have been bought with cheaper alternatives, or were not entirely essential&#8230; still, I&#8217;m not complaining. I&#8217;m just glad to have a running vehicle for a Daily Driver, and one that I&#8217;m not paranoid about when I drive it places. I hope to get the money I invested into this thing back by using it as a workhorse.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Given my previous smog failures\u00a01 |\u00a02 with the Previa, I was left in a bit of a predicament.
