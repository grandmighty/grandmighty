And on the flip side, the OEM armrest ashtray now doesn&#8217;t fit properly. Its fitment was never perfect, since the armrest is a RHD only part so the contours were slightly mismatched, but now it&#8217;s so off that the driver side edge will not even seat. Strange, because all I did was have the panels repainted and then reinstalled all the components onto them. Either way, I will be going back to the regular USDM ashtray. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpanels.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpanels-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"interiorpanels\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5062\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpanels-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpanels-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpanels.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still waiting on the gauge cluster surround&#8230; it had to be repainted a couple more times. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, I installed the climate control panel, shifter surround, and the stereo.
