That&#8217;s because up until now, I&#8217;ve primarily been preoccupied with waiting for the related parts to finalize and arrive in my hands. <\/p>\n<p>Even if an individual does not turn a single wrench and is merely a credit card warrior, this still should not be seen under a trivial light. The fact is, even the task of picking and choosing what parts to buy takes skill and guile. This is compounded when you&#8217;re dealing with a more obscure car, as the options are more limited and require greater assessments. <\/p>\n<p>For me, I wanted the best single turbo kit I could get for this car. One of the paths I could have chosen was to go with a Full Race manifold and then piece together the rest of the kit; however, I wasn&#8217;t too intrigued by their long-runner design. My priority is to maximize responsiveness and not necessarily power output. In the end, I decided to go with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.a-spectuning.com\">A-Spec Tuning<\/a> from Chicago because they specifically offer a revised short-runner manifold. Additionally, their long history with RX-7&#8217;s and quality build materials have established a bit of a cult following. <\/p>\n<p>There was, of course, a stipulation. As much as A-spec is known for their quality, they are just as known for the amount of time it takes to deliver a kit. This ended up being no exception for me&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>I got the jump on this single turbo project early, and placed my order back in October. My manifold was supposedly already made at the time, but it wasn&#8217;t until mid-January that I received my first package. The turbo came separately about a week later. Then I discovered that I was given Precision wastegates when I ordered Tials&#8230; so that took a couple more weeks to sort out. Furthermore, the dump pipes were forgotten from my package and dragged out the waiting even longer. <\/p>\n<p>While the experience was quite taxing and wearying, because a lot of money and time was on the line, it was a necessary deed. I like to anecdotally reference the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld&#8230; somewhat similar. <\/p>\n<p>With patience and perseverance comes great rewards, and in this case, it came in the form of extreme turbo porno. A-Spec did eventually come through and deliver me my full kit. <\/p>\n<p>Here is the ceramic-coated twin-scroll manifold with a divided T4 flange.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/aspecmanifold.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/aspecmanifold-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"aspecmanifold\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4381\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/aspecmanifold-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/aspecmanifold-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/aspecmanifold.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And the main show &#8211; I went with a state-of-the-art double ceramic ball bearing Precision 5866 turbo with CNC billet CEA compressor wheel. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precisionturbo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precisionturbo-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"precisionturbo\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4385\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precisionturbo-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precisionturbo-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precisionturbo.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision5866.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision5866-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"precision5866\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4384\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision5866-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision5866-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision5866.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"precision\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4383\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/precision.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The 5866 itself is an interesting setup and A-Spec helped recommend this to me to achieve my response goals. In comparison to a Garrett GT35R, the 5866 has a larger turbine but a smaller compressor. It is basically a hybrid of a 5876 compressor with a 7666 turbine. <\/p>\n<p>For the wastegates, I opted to go all-out in this department. I am simply sick of boost creep issues with RX-7&#8217;s. On the stock sequentials, all it potentially takes is a removal of the catalytic converter to be stuck with uncontrollable boost. This didn&#8217;t exactly imbue a sense of confidence, I felt like the car was a time bomb and I never wanted to boost too much. Not the way a car should be driven. <\/p>\n<p>To back my intentions of ridding this problem, I embodied the solution in a pair of 44mm Tial MV-R&#8217;s. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tialmvr.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tialmvr-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"tialmvr\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4386\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tialmvr-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tialmvr-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tialmvr.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, here are the long-awaited dump pipes. The larger one fit well but the smaller one was way too short.
