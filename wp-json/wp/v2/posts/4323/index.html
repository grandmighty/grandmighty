This set up should be able to support past 500HP, although I won&#8217;t be pushing anywhere close to that. I was eventually able to amass this collection of goodies: <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/fuelsupplies.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/fuelsupplies-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"fuelsupplies\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4326\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/fuelsupplies-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/fuelsupplies-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/fuelsupplies.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/idinjectors.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/idinjectors-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"idinjectors\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4329\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/idinjectors-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/idinjectors-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/idinjectors.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I bought more push lock fittings than necessary to have spares, and it&#8217;s a good thing I did, because 3 of them were sacrificed in the process of the install. I first measured out and cut the lengths out of a Fragola 8000 hose, but when I tried to push on the fittings, it just wasn&#8217;t happening. The tolerances between the Fragola hose and the Red Horse Performance fittings I had were slightly off, and that was enough to make it impossible. So I switched over to an Earl&#8217;s Super Stock fuel hose, and that was a good match &#8211; but still by no means easy. <\/p>\n<p>I wasted enough effort with the first setup and it was getting late by the time I finally got one fitting installed. So the next morning, I decided to enlist the help of someone I thought would be better suited for the job. I wanted to hedge against uncertainty and make sure all the fittings would be pushed on all the way, there were no more second tries &#8211; supplies were dwindling. By the design of the push lock barbs, if you stop pushing while half-way on, it becomes very difficult to fully seat the hose.<\/p>\n<p>To help further guarantee a successful outcome, I took all possible preparations: the fittings were left in the freezer to contract the metal, the barbs were lubricated with oil, and the hose was boiled in water to expand the rubber. Mr. <a href=\"http:\/\/freshlove.7tuned.com\">Freshlove<\/a> (check out his blog) made the job look like easy money. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/pogi.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/pogi.jpg\" alt=\"pogi\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4330\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Fuel lines complete.
