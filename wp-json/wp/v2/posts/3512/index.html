My original intentions were to keep this car for as long as possible. Honest. After finishing off all the recent maintenance work, the Mini was very nearly complete for me. If I had kept the car, my only major plan was to swap out the antiquated, 50&#8217;s era fuel tanks for a single, contemporary fuel cell. The design of the OEM tanks did not offer the best of seals. Good for the charm, but not quite so good for the function. <\/p>\n<p>Although the experience was short-lived, the car was great fun and memorable. Driving a right-hand drive classic is truly a different animal. Relatively speaking, the Mini is easy to work on and parts are surprisingly readily available. A great choice as a first foray into the world of classics. <\/p>\n<p>If I had kept the car, it would have been stored away indefinitely (boo, I know). I do admit that selling the Mini came at good timing, since I need to focus on an in-progress shift. This is my final consolidation as I have now sold everything&#8230; the only thing I can really call to my name right now is the Fiat, and even that is technically not mine, being that it was leased. When put into this perspective, I&#8217;ve undergone a rather sad twist of fate. <\/p>\n<p>Fear not, for I am not discouraged. Far from it, once I can get my feet back on the ground in the coming month, new plans will hatch.<\/p>\n<p>I hope the new owner Todd is enjoying the company of this Mini, and I hope to one day venture back into a classic car.
