Furthermore, being down low and in an open area allows for increased air flow.<\/p>\n<p>I also connected the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2013\/01\/more-progress-three\/\">Magnacore spark plug wires<\/a> and buttoned up the coils. In my haste to get rid of the sequential system rat&#8217;s nest, I overlooked an important bracket necessary to mount the coil assembly (sold it away). Everything under there is intertwined with each other, and this bracket was actually an offshoot of the rat&#8217;s nest assembly.<\/p>\n<p>This lead to a dilemma as I wasn&#8217;t sure how to find such a specific part. I called Mazda and they no longer carried it. I decided to try a Want to Buy ad on RX7Club&#8217;s classifieds. It was more or less a shot in the dark, but within a couple hours of posting, Ihor from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irperformance.com\">IRPerformance<\/a> came to the rescue. It&#8217;s a blessing that this car still maintains a strong resource-sharing community.<\/p>\n<p>The clear braided hose in the picture below is a PVC Tygon line I&#8217;m using to vent\/catch blow-by. I deleted the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) in the process. I may add in a catch-can in the future if the hose is not adequate and I notice excess oil in the intake tracts, but it shouldn&#8217;t be an issue in less than racing conditions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/coilpacks.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4342\" alt=\"coilpacks\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/coilpacks-777x518.jpg\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/coilpacks-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/coilpacks-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/coilpacks.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I like to do my own work for a reason. It allows me to dictate full control of the operation and impart a more crucial eye. I feel that certain levels of attention to detail cannot be captured when you drop your car off to someone else &#8211; only unless you&#8217;re prepared to sign a big check.<\/p>\n<p>For example, one of the benefits I&#8217;m able to enjoy is being able to handpick everything to my liking, down to even the replacement vacuum hoses. Even though there are barely any vacuum hoses left, it&#8217;s still an area that deserves scrutiny. Here&#8217;s a picture of a 3.5mm silicone vacuum hose I&#8217;m intending to use for the Blow-off Valve &#8211; the walls are nice and thick.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/vacuumhose.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4345\" alt=\"vacuumhose\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/vacuumhose-777x518.jpg\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/vacuumhose-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/vacuumhose-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/vacuumhose.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On the subject of vacuum hoses, I&#8217;m amazed at just how simplified the vacuum system is now.
