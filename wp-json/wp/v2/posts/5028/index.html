While I&#8217;m lucky to be in California where a &#8220;real&#8221; Winter does not exist, I still want to drive the car before the rain starts. The plan was to lower the car off the jack stands last weekend, except I had to buy another set of non-REVO Project Kics R40 lug nuts to clear the front ARP studs. This is probably my 4th or 5th set of these Project Kics&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2013\/08\/advan-rs-rz-with-toyo-r888\/\">Advans<\/a>, wheel changes are going to be a lot more tedious now. The lug holes on these wheels are super deep into the face, and there&#8217;s minimal room to navigate with a socket. A quick slip-up will easily scratch the wheel&#8217;s paint. By design of the RS\/RZ, the spokes are slightly protruding outward near the rim, which is going to be an area of high debris susceptibility. I&#8217;m going to have to get the dark gunmetal paint color-matched and keep a small touch-up bottle.<\/p>\n<p>Other than that, the wheels have definitely affirmed my allegiance to 18&#8243; sizes. While 17&#8243; wheels can look great, after trying out both, I think 18&#8243; wins in its overall presence.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/blackR2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/blackR2-777x522.jpg\" alt=\"blackR2\" width=\"777\" height=\"522\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5029\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/blackR2-777x522.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/blackR2-960x646.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/blackR2.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Fingers crossed I can finally get my trim panels back soon and button up the interior.
