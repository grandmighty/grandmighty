I got this car on July 4th of 2008, and sold it a couple weeks ago. During that time period, I spent an insane amount of time and money modding it. When I look back now, I realize how big of a mistake that was&#8230; at least from a monetary and time consumption stand point. All the experience I gained from working on the car is invaluable, and is the one thing I will remember the car by.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the last pictures I was able to take of the car, in it&#8217;s final stages&#8230; in other words, when I was satisfied with it, and considered it &#8220;done.&#8221; I was more-or-less burned out from working on it so much, and for no real purpose. I was hardly home because of school, so the car was very rarely driven. When I did drive it, I would usually just use it to go around the block or get some food. I realized I had no use for this car to constantly sit in the garage and hold up money, which is what lead me to sell it. Now that it is gone, I have no regrets. So why did I do all that work, if I was just going to sell it? I honestly couldn&#8217;t tell you, but I was too focused on it. I had an agenda to make the car how I wanted, and didn&#8217;t stop until I got there&#8230; once I got there, then I discovered the fault.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"..\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1\" src=\"..\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/1-590x391.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-62\" title=\"6\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/6-590x391.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/6-590x391.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/6-1024x679.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/6.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-60\" title=\"8\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/8-590x391.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/8-590x391.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/8-1024x679.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/8.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-63\" title=\"7\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/7-590x724.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"724\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/7-590x724.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/7-833x1024.jpg 833w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/7.jpg 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I meticulously logged progress on the RX-7 as I went, all that information can be found on <a href=\"http:\/\/projectfd.com\">http:\/\/projectfd.com <\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now why was showing off my car relevant? Because with the sale, I&#8217;ve adapted to a new perspective. I think the whole modding cars business, especially in the way I did it, portrays too much vanity. Too many kids these days are into sticker bombing their cars and putting trinkets everywhere, then drive it to &#8220;meets&#8221; and park it. What&#8217;s the point? So other guys can jock your faux-luis vuitton covered trim panels, or excuse me, your vast creativity.<\/p>\n<p>Either way I&#8217;m not hating, just saying. I just don&#8217;t see a point in all that effort. I&#8217;m out of it, and I don&#8217;t see myself modding a car to be cool ever again. To prove it, I&#8217;m currently actively seeking a 4 cylinder Toyota 4-Runner for it&#8217;s utility purposes.<\/p>\n<p>To carry my new rationale even further, I&#8217;ve completely lost the desire to have a fancy, fast sports car in general&#8230; or at least for a while. My new passion is in the form of 2 wheels, and with it, I realize just how boring cars are to me now.<\/p>\n<p>I had to get all that off my shoulders :)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I felt that introducing my old car would be appropriate in setting an undertone for this website and the posts to come.
