Unfortunately, once it was all complete, the front-end of the car actually dropped by almost 1\/4&#8243;. This meant I had to go back home and bust out the coilover spanners to redo the ride height once more. Obviously, doing so also negated the perfect alignment I just received. I&#8217;ll eventually go back and get a second alignment. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A couple weeks ago, I got out of classes early one day and made my way over to AutoRnD.
