The brake pedal feel was good, but if you braked too hard, the whole van shakes. Sometimes, even if you didn&#8217;t brake hard, the van would shake to a stop. There was also an echoing sound from the rear drum brakes. Figured from a safety perspective, the brakes needed to be changed.<\/p>\n<p>And if I was going to have them changed, might as well change it all:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakepackage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-322\" title=\"brakepackage\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakepackage-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakepackage-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakepackage.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakerotor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-323\" title=\"brakerotor\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakerotor-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakerotor-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakerotor.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakeshoes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-324\" title=\"brakeshoes\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakeshoes-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakeshoes-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/brakeshoes.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I ended up going the whole nine-yards. New front rotors, brake pads, rear drum, drum shoes, and drum springs. I even had to change the front calipers. While the van was at the shop, I got a call to come check it out. The passenger side front caliper turned out to be leaking rather badly, so I had to buy a new set of calipers.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, since the coolant was a dirty orange color, I decided to give it a flush.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previacoolant.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-325\" title=\"previacoolant\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previacoolant-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previacoolant-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/previacoolant.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I threw in some Prestone Coolant System Cleaner.

Also, I found out the Michelin wiper blades won&#8217;t work with the Previa, because it requires some stupid specific ones that have a washer nozzle in them. I was originally going to use the Bumper Coating to refresh the wiper arms, but now I&#8217;m going to say screw it.
