Everything was going great until I started swapping the HVAC panel&#8217;s dials. The panel I sent to Toby to perform the custom work on was a &#8217;93. The panel originally from my car is a &#8217;94. As it turns out, there is another difference between &#8217;93 and &#8217;94 HVAC panels aside from the paint texture &#8211; the blower position indicator dial. The support piece that holds this particular dial&#8217;s graphics was not the same. The &#8217;93 uses a clear acrylic pedestal like the other dials, but the &#8217;94 has a black plastic pedestal with a dimensionally different inner diameter that would not fit. Whether this is a cost-cutting move by Mazda, I have no idea. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/interiorhvactrim.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/interiorhvactrim-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"interiorhvactrim\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5843\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/interiorhvactrim-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/interiorhvactrim-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/interiorhvactrim-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/interiorhvactrim-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/interiorhvactrim.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I was left with a few options, and because I gave myself a compressed schedule of only 2 weeks, I exhausted all of them simultaneously. 1.) I ripped off the dirty dial graphic from the &#8217;93 acrylic support and spent a couple hours slowly cleaning and dissolving all the glue residue and gunk. 2.) I bought a set of reproduction dial face stickers from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackcatcustom.com\/mazda_rx_7.htm\">Black Cat Custom Automotive<\/a>. They had a long turn around time, but I opted to proceed as a last choice backup. 3.) The only way to buy a new set of OEM dial graphics is to buy the entire HVAC trim panel from Mazda. So that&#8217;s what I did. Prioritizing expediency, I purchased it through a local Mazda dealership. They wouldn&#8217;t let me pay over the phone for the order and I had to endure traffic after work and pay in person, minutes before their closing. A couple days later, the panel arrived &#8211; repeat the after work traffic rush to pick it up. <\/p>\n<p>Although this was a &#8217;93 panel, I soon realized, much to my dismay, that Mazda was simply painting &#8217;94+ panels in the smooth &#8217;93 finish. The position indicator&#8217;s pedestal was the exact same black plastic piece from my car, and not the clear acrylic support I needed. I decided to try plan 3-B.) and peeled off the new piece&#8217;s graphic sticker and transferred it onto my freshly cleaned acrylic support. This went well, until I noticed a slight factory imperfection on the graphic&#8217;s print. When I tried to clean it off, everything went south and the print was quickly ruined. I&#8217;m wondering if Mazda used cheaper ink on the newer stuff&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>Since that failed, I ripped off the wasted sticker and instead transferred over the original graphic from my car. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/dialgraphics.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/dialgraphics-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"dialgraphics\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5823\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/dialgraphics-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/dialgraphics-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/dialgraphics-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/dialgraphics-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/dialgraphics.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I finally had a successful outcome, but maximized my contingencies by leveraging option 4.) and acquired, via overnight shipping, a spare &#8217;93 HVAC panel from a buddy that had a spare one laying around. I ended up not needing it and it was too worn for me to use any way, thus concluding the saga. <\/p>\n<p>Here is the HVAC panel complete with nice, clean dial graphics. I reused the hot\/cold graphic from my original &#8217;94. Notice the difference in its design versus the juxtaposed &#8217;93 that I&#8217;m holding in the picture below. I backdated my dash to a &#8217;93 and sans passenger air bag, but kept &#8217;94 touches like this&#8230; which I think is cool.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/93vs94.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/93vs94-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"93vs94\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5819\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/93vs94-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/93vs94-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/93vs94-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/93vs94-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/93vs94.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>I know this post became rather costive and lost to the drudgery of the &#8217;93 vs &#8217;94 trivia, but I feel that it was nonetheless important to highlight. All of this brings into perspective the emblematic difficulty level associated with car work. <\/p>\n<p>Average is performing basic mods on a car to a &#8220;good enough&#8221; level and feeling satisfied. Average, however, is too boring and facile. The true difficulty is exemplified and exponentially increased when operating at a high level of detail and tolerance. This is the area where I personally appreciate and discern the most, as it signifies a grander scheme and thought.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After nearly half a year of planning and waiting, I found myself switching roles from a behind-the-scenes bystander to the active participant.
