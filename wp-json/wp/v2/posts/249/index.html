I also didn&#8217;t have time to prep my own bike, and felt it would be better to start with a 250 at the track. I rented one of these for the day:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/feellikeapro1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-251\" title=\"feellikeapro\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/feellikeapro1-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/feellikeapro1-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/feellikeapro1.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Fun little bike but absolutely no power. I would be flooring it at 11k on the straight and people would zoom past me like I wasn&#8217;t moving. Shifting on it wasn&#8217;t even in the same league as my Ducati. I also really disliked the upright riding position of this bike, felt like a scooter almost. It was, however, very light and very easy to throw around.<\/p>\n<p>These Pirelli&#8217;s were had a ton of grip and were very sticky\/tacky at the end of the day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/pirellis.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-243\" title=\"pirellis\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/pirellis-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/pirellis-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/pirellis.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I probably drank close to 2 gallons of water. The temperatures were in the 100&#8217;s, and I had to be in a full leather suit&#8230; The most detrimental factor of the day was the fact that I was running on virtually no sleep, and with such a fatiguing activity I felt like a zombie the entire day. I had a little spur of energy after lunch, but I wish I was better rested. On the drive home, I was literally nodding off and falling asleep. I had to pull over in the middle of no where in order to get a nap in. Furthermore, having only been riding motorcycles for about a month, period, I was definitely at a handicap. Not to mention, the 250 that I rented was foreign to me, and it was the first time I rode a motorcycle in well over a week. Had to adapt quick, that&#8217;s for sure.<\/p>\n<p>All that aside, the whole experience was very humbling. I learned a lot and the practice was great. Most of the people there had experience, and there were a few sandbaggers in the C group. I remember getting passed by this girl that was leaned over dragging knee all the way down the righthander of the Hill.<\/p>\n<p>Very fun but extremely tiring and hot day. I&#8217;m definitely aiming to go back, hopefully with a bike of my own and a lot more rest.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Immediately after work on Friday, I rushed home to get ready for the Track the next day.
