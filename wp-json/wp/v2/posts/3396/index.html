Although the shifter wasn&#8217;t too radically sloppy for a 40 year old car, it could&#8217;ve been better. <\/p>\n<p>With the distributor, coil, spark plugs, and spark plug wires <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/05\/because-the-hard-way-is-funner\/\">changed<\/a>, the only thing that was left was the alternator. Not to make it feel left out, I swapped in a higher amp counterpart. With the stock alternator, the idle would drop severely when the electrical system was loaded, so hopefully the higher amps will help alleviate this to a degree.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/alternator.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/alternator-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"alternator\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3397\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/alternator-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/alternator-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/alternator.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This aluminum radiator was actually one of the first parts I bought for the Mini. It was on sale and I figured preventative maintenance never hurts, especially because the stock plastic radiators are prone to leaking anyway. On top of being all aluminum, it&#8217;s also much fatter.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/aluminumradiator.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/aluminumradiator-620x826.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"aluminumradiator\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3398\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/aluminumradiator-620x826.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/aluminumradiator.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The valve cover that came with the car was an awkward yellow color and had seen better days. To keep in theme with the radiator and coil, I decided to update it with a flat-top polished version. Since I had to remove the valve cover&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvestappets.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvestappets-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"valvestappets\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3402\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvestappets-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvestappets-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvestappets.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;it was the perfect time to adjust the valves. I set the inlet valves to .012&#8243; and the exhaust valves to .015&#8243;. The reason why I set the exhaust valves to a slightly larger gap is to help compensate for the additional heat expansion, and it offers more buffer if there is seat recession. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvegap.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvegap-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"valvegap\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3401\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvegap-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvegap-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/valvegap.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Adjusting valves is a simple affair, just tedious. I threw the transmission into top gear (4th) and manually pushed the car back and forth in the garage. With the mechanical leverage of 4th gear, rolling the car around cycles the engine and allows for the valves to open and close so that they may be adjusted accordingly. It takes patience to get all the valves set just right, and the Mini&#8217;s SOHC 4-cylinder engine is about as easy as it gets. This makes me wonder how long it&#8217;d take to adjust all <em><strong>64<\/strong><\/em> valves in a Bugatti Veyron engine.<\/p>\n<p>Last but not least&#8230; here is the new valve cover installed and sealed to top everything off. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/polishedvalvecover.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/polishedvalvecover-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"polishedvalvecover\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3400\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/polishedvalvecover-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/polishedvalvecover-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/polishedvalvecover.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;ve drastically overshot my original expectations of only doing basic maintenance on this car.
