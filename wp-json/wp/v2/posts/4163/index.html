It can be a focused hobby that is taken to an elevated level. Achieving mastery is an implied goal, and that&#8217;s why you should find one thing that you can really connect with and stick to it. My passion lies with cars, and more specifically, my RX-7. I even tried to run from it &#8211; to give up and move on&#8230; but I always knew I couldn&#8217;t escape because life would feel so much more devoid otherwise. Whether or not other people are able to fully grasp and appreciate what I do is not important. Being able to obsess over something really is a blessing in disguise. Although consuming at times, it adds a new dimension and forces me to stay motivated and driven. <\/p>\n<p>Life without passion is lived in black and white. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just finished watching this video and thoroughly enjoyed it.
