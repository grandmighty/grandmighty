My goals reached ever higher on a continuous basis. I kept firm to an unwavering vision of building the ultimate street RX-7. That kind of persistence made me iterate and redo things until I got it just right. After all, this was going to be my personal, long-term car&#8230; and there could be no compromise. <\/p>\n<p>From the day I purchased it, I followed a strict standard with close adherence to details. I specifically chose one of the rarest and most sought after RX-7s to serve as an ideal foundation: A USDM, &#8217;94, Brilliant Black, Low Miles, Low Owner Count, R2 package. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7679\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120-1250x938.jpg 1250w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/IMG_4120.jpg 2016w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My mod list, however extensive, only tells half the story. If you kept up with this website or read through the pages, you know that this was a long journey of immense effort. One that could not be replicated again &#8211; if I were to start from scratch today. <\/p>\n<p>The hindsight of thinking that I could keep a car forever parallels my misunderstanding of others who sell their sports cars to start families. I was always perplexed at why people had to sacrifice their pride and joy. Why couldn&#8217;t fun and responsibilities coexist? Well, it&#8217;s not that easy, in actuality. There is also a cruel irony to all of this. When I had more time in the past, I spent it building this car. Now that it is done, I have no time and am unable to enjoy it. Adulting is hard and catches up with everyone, and I&#8217;m not getting any younger. <\/p>\n<p>That is why I have made the conscious decision to list the car for sale. If I had more means and space, then I really could have kept it forever. But due to the magnitude of expenditure in this project, it is simply beyond the scope of allowing it to sit indefinitely. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-777x339.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"339\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7680\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-777x339.png 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-768x335.png 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-960x418.png 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-200x87.png 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-1250x545.png 1250w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-400x174.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With that said, I am selling the car at an extreme discount with respect to what has been poured in.
