While I have no need for an overly expensive and bulky DSLR, having a camera of some caliber is a necessity. In a Utopian world, cell phones would be capable of superb pictures, but this is not the case and unlikely anytime soon. After some thinking and evaluating of what I predominantly tend to shoot, I decided all that I required was a compact point &amp; shoot. I am not a professional photographer by any means, nor am I going to strive to be one, so the difference of using a camera that costs as much as some cars is nil.<\/p>\n<p>The older Canon PowerShot S90 took very nice pictures, and with the recent release of the S95&#8230; the choice was easy.<\/p>\n<p>After walking outside the garage this afternoon, I spotted a small package sitting on the porch, which had this inside :)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/s95front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"s95front\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/s95front-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/canons95.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-697\" title=\"canons95\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/canons95-540x405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/canons95-540x405.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/canons95.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So far after a couple test shots, I am very pleased with the image quality.
