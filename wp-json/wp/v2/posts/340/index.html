I should probably mention that I sold my Ducati 848. By now, it probably seems like I have a disorder on a medical level since I go through things rather quickly. As spontaneous as the sale of the Ducati was, it, along with everything else I go through and change, I see as pertinent stepping stones. I can&#8217;t really find out what I want until I gain insight through first hand experiences.<\/p>\n<p>My primary ambition from the first day I went forward with my M1 license training was to eventually take the riding to the track. Getting a nice bike to ride on the street seemed like the most logical approach to get started. Then, after riding for a while, or in this case, after <em>not<\/em> riding for a while, I realized riding in the street wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d do regularly. I don&#8217;t commute with a motorcycle simply because it&#8217;s too inconvenient to gear up and to be limited in what you can carry, etc. After the track day at Thunderhill, I became more focused and really wanted to develop my skills at the track more. This is where priority comes in, and thus I decided it was a necessary deed to sell the Ducati in order to fund a track only bike. Of course, I could&#8217;ve just turned the 848 into a track bike; however, it&#8217;s much too expensive for me to be able to abuse. I have to settle for something cheaper.<\/p>\n<p>I was able to sell the Ducati on Monday. Afterwards, I had to immediately head for San Francisco International and catch a flight Denver. I had to do a good amount of travelling within Colorado this past week. By the end of the trip, the rental car allocated approximately 600-700 additional miles.<\/p>\n<p>Upon landing in Denver, I drove south to Colorado Springs where the hotel was. Then it was off to University of Colorado at Colorado Springs in the morning for work.<\/p>\n<p>I believe Pike&#8217;s Peak is somewhere along the mountains in the background. I wanted to check it out, but unfortunately there just wasn&#8217;t time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/uccs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-346\" title=\"uccs\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/uccs-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/uccs-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/uccs.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The next day, it was back on the road to a podunk, quaint town called La Junta.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradocountry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-341\" title=\"coloradocountry\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradocountry-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradocountry-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradocountry.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Where work was done at their local community college.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/oterocollege.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-344\" title=\"oterocollege\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/oterocollege-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/oterocollege-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/oterocollege.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I actually stayed in La Junta that night, because further testing was due the next morning. Little did I know, this town had absolutely no Taxi service and the rental car was with a coworker that day. Luckily, I was able to bum a ride from a maintenance guy back to the college. Otherwise, I would&#8217;ve had to walk \u00a0about 3 miles&#8230; it&#8217;s not the distance that&#8217;s challenging, it&#8217;s that Southern Colorado gets hot.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, all the testing was accomplished by noon, then it was back onto the road to another town called Lamar. Check out downtown Lamar. These people must really like America&#8217;s fast food chains, as virtually every single one was showcased within a mile&#8217;s stretch.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/lamar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-343\" title=\"lamar\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/lamar-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/lamar-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/lamar.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>After finishing the work in Lamar, it was time to drive 3 hours back to Denver for the night.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradohorizon.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"coloradohorizon\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradohorizon-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradohorizon-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/coloradohorizon.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This morning, I said goodbye to the Rockies and flew back to California after a long week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/rockies1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-347\" title=\"rockies\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/rockies1-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/rockies1-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/rockies1.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One notable point you might&#8217;ve noticed in the pictures above, is that Colorado has a lot of cool clouds, especially above the\u00a0prairie lands.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s see&#8230; where to start.
