Progress on the car has been steady, albeit at an unusually slow pace that has been dictated by the delays of the oCarbon trim overlays. I am still waiting for the remaining pieces to be completed and trickle in so I can finally put the remainder of my interior back together. Until that happens, I am taking small steps from my end to keep things moving, but because I would prefer finishing strong and in larger leaps, this prolonged time schedule has been hampering with my motivation to an extent. <\/p>\n<p>When the flow is active and tasks are being accomplished at a desired rate, that kind of momentum tends to also be reflected in the frequency at which I bring up posts. Anyway, enough of the excuses, because waiting or not &#8211; I do still have content to talk about. So let&#8217;s get back to the groove. <\/p>\n<p>With the gauge fascia completed and in my possession, the next step was to work on the implementation of LED momentary buttons. Previously, I had non-illuminated buttons mounted on the fascia to control the menus on the MXG dash. One night when I was driving through a dimly lit street, I peered down and realized the inadequacy of having the dark buttons in the car, exaggerated by the fact that every else featured illumination. During the past Winter, while I was first getting started with this interior revamp project, I purchased a set of metal momentary buttons that matched my existing ones, except they had a red LED ring in the middle. <\/p>\n<p>But before I could get into the wiring, I had to fix a small problem with the MXG itself. I accidentally put a scratch on the bottom of the screen (by the logo) when removing the fascia from the car. Trying to polish the scratch only marred it and made it worse.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7370\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aimmxg.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Luckily, AiM has great customer support and their technical services center in Lake Elsinore was willing to replace the entire screen and bezel for me at no cost.

And now with the LEDs, each button had an additional pair of leads which required, in total, 16 individual 22-gauge wires to be connected. This was quite time consuming because I had to manually wind the stripped ends of each wire around the tiny poles on the buttons and then solder them into place. I used aircraft grade Tefzel wires for this job, which is overkill by an extraordinary margin. What can I say, I like excess. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aiminstall.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aiminstall-777x1036.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7386\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aiminstall-777x1036.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aiminstall-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aiminstall-150x200.jpg 150w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aiminstall-400x533.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/aiminstall.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I had the Tefzel wires in the first place because of my original intent to step up the connector to an 8-block Deutsch DTM. The wires were in the same neighborhood so I bought everything at once. Previously, I used a basic Molex connector for Computers which served its purpose handily, but was lacking in terms of overall quality. Arguably, for a simple and low-stress application like the momentary buttons and their LEDs, using Deutsch connectors is like eating cereal with a 24-karat gold spoon&#8230; it is beyond reasonable comprehension but still damn cool. And I&#8217;m glad I did it because I was able to see first hand how well designed and superior the Deutsch stuff is. Yes, even plastic wire connectors can be over engineered. <\/p>\n<p>With the provided male and female crimps, everything clicked into place and assembled together inside the housings effortlessly. The pins are sequentially numbered and the housings feature rubber seals for weatherproofing (not exactly required for the interior of a car). After all of the soldering work I have been doing, I finally bought one of these Helping Hands to hold the wires in place instead of awkwardly balancing objects together all of the time. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7389\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/solderholder.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is a look at the connector from the car side. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7331\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutsch.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And from the fascia side. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutschconnector.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutschconnector-777x1036.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7387\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutschconnector-777x1036.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutschconnector-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutschconnector-150x200.jpg 150w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutschconnector-400x533.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/deutschconnector.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Due to the small size of the momentary buttons and consequently the LEDs inside of them, they are DC 3V instead of 12V. This meant I needed to incorporate a resistor into the circuit to convert and bring down the voltage. I wired the 4 LEDs in series and the calculated resistor needed appeared to be around 220ohm. After soldering in the resistor, I brought everything to the car and did a test run. Modern day LEDs are highly efficient, especially in comparison to conventional bulbs. This is why LEDs are far brighter under the same power circumstances. In my case, even though the car&#8217;s 12V current was being tapered down by the resistor for the 3V LEDs, I still found them to be too bright. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-7388\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/futurespec.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I cut off the 220ohm resistor and experimented via trial and error with different ohm resistors.
