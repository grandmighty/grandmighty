At the same time, I realized I haven&#8217;t posted anything <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/category\/cycling\/\">Cycling<\/a> related in months, mainly because I&#8217;m not devoted to the sport as heavily anymore. In the past, cycling was a fun hobby for me, especially since riding a bicycle was my only way of getting around college. I used to build bikes like I did cars and frequented group rides. Now I don&#8217;t even have a bike of my own and I ride by myself. <\/p>\n<p>While I may not be as particular about bicycles as I once was, it will always be something I do. I don&#8217;t know exactly when my metabolism is going to slow down, or whatever, but when it does, this is my way of making sure I have a contingency in place. I don&#8217;t hit gym and don&#8217;t like running&#8230; hence why I ride a bike for exercise (although I would take up swimming if that was more feasible). As for what to actually ride, the arrangement I have now works out nicely. I just borrow my Dad&#8217;s road bike when I need it, usually to ride home from work. I aim for at least once a week&#8230; yet this target is realistically closer to once every 2 weeks. <\/p>\n<p>On each of these rides, I try to reduce my times. This week, I discovered the effectiveness an impetus can have on pace. I was at work longer than planned, and with the already early-setting of the sun, it became a bid for light. When riding next to cars, I&#8217;m not too fond of riding at night, especially during this season when there can be a half hour to an hour gap of darkness before the street lamps come on. I didn&#8217;t push myself over the limit or anything, but was able to maintain a more consistent pace and covered the 20 mile Northbound trek in 50 minutes. I haven&#8217;t ridden Southbound yet, but it should be noticeably quicker in that direction since there&#8217;s little headwind and 2 major hill climbs become downhills. <\/p>\n<p>Anyway, my goal is to keep my time around the 50 minutes to an hour range or better&#8230; and of course to ride more often.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A long-time member of this site&#8217;s fan club (1 of like&#8230; 3) reminded me that an update was overdue&#8230; so here I am indulging.
