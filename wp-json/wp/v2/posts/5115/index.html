But first, let&#8217;s begin with a bit of backstory to help elevate the anticipation.<\/p>\n<p>What have I been doing these past 4 months? I have deliberately liberated myself from the car scene\u00a0and pushed it onto the side burner. Not having to drag myself into the garage on weekends to wrench on the RX-7 has been quite a welcomed vacation, if I&#8217;m honest. As per usual, I drove the car very little during this time period &#8211; maybe 4-5 times. And therein lies a deeply rooted fallacy which will ultimately serve as the catalyst to a new, transformative ideology.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, while commuting to work in my daily driver, I began contemplating about why I so rarely drive the RX-7 and why I was complacent with letting layers of dust accrue on its bodywork. The irony of it all baffled and disappointed me. I&#8217;ve invested so much work and time into this car, yet I hardly get to enjoy the fruits of my labor. While lost in my train of thought, I had an epiphany that would rouse my ire. I determined that going forward, I would drive the car 2-3 times a week. In order to realize this vow, I would do so by taking the plunge into the\u00a0V8 swap world. Vacation time had ended, it was time to get back on\u00a0saddle.<\/p>\n<p>The thought of going V8 lingered with me consistently since the day I bought the RX-7. I probably should have gone this route earlier and bypassed the Single Turbo conversion. I wanted to hold onto the rotary platform out of conformity and to maintain a sense of righteousness. In the passing time, I&#8217;ve even been plotting out the eventual rebuild and the port and balancing work I would want done. I kept myself busy on this path by acquiring various parts and upgrades (like the <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2013\/12\/full-race-twin-scroll-manifold\/\">Full Race manifold<\/a>) for the next iteration of the engine. Now push came to shove and I can bear this direction no longer.<\/p>\n<p>I like to see myself as a pragmatic and logical person (usually [well, hopefully]). After yielding my false sense of loyalty to the &#8220;purity&#8221; of the RX-7, no further justifications existed to keep me. Staying rotary simply defied sensible conventions in my eyes. Going V8\u00a0packages both reliability AND more power. I will be swapping in a stock motor that&#8217;s anchored by readily available GM parts. The days of worrying about seals letting go and having to deal with rebuilding and buying parts for a niche product needs to be over. Furthermore, to reach the same power levels as the stock V8, a 13B-REW would need to be &#8220;heavily&#8221; modified and thus compromise its drivability and longevity. A stock V8 is truly the best of both worlds right from the onset. This is key to enabling me to drive the car on a semi-daily basis.<\/p>\n<p>Albeit I simplified the 13B-REW with the single turbo conversion, it was still not without its drawbacks. I have to dedicate 5 minutes to warm it up before taking off and it averages less than 13-15 MPG. Needing to fill up twice a week while performing a chemistry experiment with Premix each time gets old.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s truly a blessing and is essentially fateful that a large V8 motor can fit comfortably inside the RX-7&#8217;s engine bay. In addition,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rx7v8.com\">Samberg Performance<\/a> makes a well engineered and fabricated mounting kit for these cars. The swap certainly won&#8217;t be a hodgepodge affair, all of the components used will be an increase in quality in every way. Even more momentous is the fact that Samberg Performance is from Pleasanton, CA&#8230; a mere 25 minutes away from where I live.<\/p>\n<p>Pursuing a car that is at its core\u00a0raw and analog provides a stark contrast to all the technology laden cars of today, and underpins my ideals. Owning this RX-7 is my choice, and I made this choice based on my desire to mold and build something to personal\u00a0requirements &#8211; to stand apart. With that said, I could never fully connect with turbochargers and saw them as contradictions to my preferred direction. They added complication.\u00a0In juxtaposition to a naturally aspirated power plant, turbochargers seem more diluted. The combination of forced induction&#8217;s thin-line tolerance with the fraility of a rotary is something I&#8217;m happy to be stepping away from.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a 4 month hiatus, I&#8217;m back and with\u00a0big news.
