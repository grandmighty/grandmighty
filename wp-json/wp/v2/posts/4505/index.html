In this scenario, there are 2 choices: ignore it and move on or take care of it. I yielded and opted for the latter.<\/p>\n<p>All the new fuel lines I&#8217;m running are -6AN, which means they have an inner diameter of 3\/8&#8243;. Attaching these lines to the smaller 5\/16&#8243; factory hardlines led to a predicament. The solutions appeared to be limited. One way was to cut off the barbs on the hardlines and install a compression fitting, but I was skeptical on how much pressure such an adapter could hold. Another method was to flare the hardlines further with a special tool. I wasn&#8217;t very enticed by either of these and they were both relatively invasive.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, after seeking insight from 3 separate individuals, they all reported having simply double clamped the -6AN line over the hardlines. So said why not, and joined in.<\/p>\n<p>At first, I double clamped my lines on and then decided to triple clamp them to help assuage my neuroticism. Fast forward to more recently, I was doing more research on other viable options out of curiosity (going back to the whole stuck on my mind thing), and ended up calling <a href=\"http:\/\/flyinmiata.com\">Flyin&#8217; Miata<\/a>. They offer a big fuel kit for Miatas and had everything figured out. <em>Apparently<\/em>, there&#8217;s ONE company (Aeromotive) that makes a special 5\/16&#8243; barb to -6AN male adapter. Finally, this was something that made a lot of sense.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to buy 2 of these adapters from Flyin&#8217; Miata and had them Express mail them to me. It was hard to suck it up and redo the lines at the last minute, but I knew it would be better to take care of everything sooner rather than later. I&#8217;m sure my triple clamping would have worked fine, but it bugged me because it seemed fundamentally wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I undid all my hard triple clamping work, removed the Feed line, and bought the appropriate push lock fittings. I took the opportunity to redo the Feed line entirely because it was originally mounted to the secondary rail with a straight fitting, but I switched it to a 45* fitting instead to lessen the bend in the line.<\/p>\n<p>On the other end of the Feed and Return lines, I pushed on straight fittings. I purposely chose Blue for these to add contrast down by the firewall where they will be attaching to the adapter and hardlines. I think I&#8217;ve gotten quite good at installing push lock fittings now. For the Feed line, I was able to do everything off the car on my workbench, but I left the Return line attached. This meant I had to push on the straight fitting without a surface to press against, and had to do it all against my palm.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/straightpushloc.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4494\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/straightpushloc-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"straightpushloc\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/straightpushloc-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/straightpushloc-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/straightpushloc.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is everything connected back up with the new adapters in place.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/516barbadapter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4488\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/516barbadapter-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"516barbadapter\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/516barbadapter-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/516barbadapter-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/516barbadapter.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now, instead of force clamping a 3\/8&#8243; line over a 5\/16&#8243; barb&#8230; I&#8217;m using a short section of 5\/16&#8243; fuel injection hose from the hardlines to the 5\/16&#8243; barb end of the adapters, which then converts and connects normally to the -6AN straight fittings. I also Express mailed new spring clamps from Mazda to help with the process. On the hardlines, I&#8217;m using both a worm gear clamp (with a smooth underside so it doesn&#8217;t cut into the hoses too much) and a spring clamp.<\/p>\n<p>Talk about one aspect of the build being drawn out&#8230; but I knew I couldn&#8217;t shortcut anything, especially when it comes to fuel.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When something lingers in your mind, it&#8217;s probably doing so for a reason.
