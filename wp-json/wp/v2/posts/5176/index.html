After a period of contemplation, I settled on a set of Spoolin Performance headers for their incorporation of merge collectors. These headers seemed to be of good quality and construction versus the competition. The community consensus for fitment appears to be straightforward as well, so I&#8217;m hoping it will be the same for me.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Spoolin was out of stock on their headers and I actually picked up their last 1-3\/4&#8243; headers at the time. The slightly larger 1-7\/8&#8243; headers were sold out. However, my research suggests that the noticeable difference between the 2 sizes should be minimal performance wise &#8211; depending on the setup. 1-7\/8&#8243; is supposed to generate better peak power and best suited for forced induction or larger displacements (400+ CI). 1-3\/4&#8243; should deliver the power more in the midrange, which compliments street driving well. Since my LS3 is stock and I have no realistic plans of drastically changing that fact in the future, I have no qualms of settling with the 1-3\/4&#8243; version. I&#8217;m hoping the smaller runners will also aid in body clearance, since every millimeter will count.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/lsxheaders.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5185\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/lsxheaders.jpg\" alt=\"lsxheaders\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a shot of the inside of one of the merge collectors.
