For better or worse, I typically <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2011\/04\/hall-of-meat\/\">don&#8217;t let the weather stop me<\/a>. My neighbor came through and was down to ride as well, because I doubt anyone else would have been. Gotta give this guy credit, not only is he constantly on his bike (whereas I&#8217;m on mine once a week if I&#8217;m lucky), but he&#8217;s been riding the same old Fuji conversion fixed gear for years now. Even though I led the majority of this ride, he kept up no problem which is impressive, given that I was on a road bike.<\/p>\n<p>One thing is for certain, we were both completely fried by the end of this ride. We rode mostly the same route as before into Livermore, but backtracked and went the same way back so we wouldn&#8217;t have to ride down a freeway again&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Although the temperatures were already high, Livermore is a valley so it was truly oven-like. The total ride into and around Livermore and back was around 50 miles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/livermorevineyard.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2289\" title=\"livermorevineyard\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/livermorevineyard-600x448.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/livermorevineyard-600x448.png 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/livermorevineyard-900x672.png 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/livermorevineyard-210x156.png 210w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/livermorevineyard.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The ride back home was brutal with all the headwind.
