The long wait aside, this is what the old catalytic converter looked like. I can see why the car failed smog so badly previously&#8230; half of the insides are missing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/deadcat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-288\" title=\"deadcat\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/deadcat-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/deadcat-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/deadcat.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Once everything was finished, this is what the new muffler looks like. I think I went a little overkill with the muffler choice, but the car definitely sounds louder. It&#8217;s nice to actually be able to hear the engine rather than the whistling noise the old exhaust made.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/magnaflowrace.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-289\" title=\"magnaflowrace\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/magnaflowrace-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/magnaflowrace-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/magnaflowrace.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I also threw on some DriftUnit license plate bracket for kicks. And to be a little ironic. I&#8217;m not actually the biggest fan of drifting.<\/p>\n<p>Now I had thought all grounds were covered&#8230; I changed almost everything related to emissions. I went back to the smog station for round 2, and the car failed again. The results were much better, however. The HydroCarbons were clear now and no longer a gross polluter. The only thing it&#8217;s failing is the NOx readings at 15 mph&#8230; very close but no cigar. At least the second try was free. Not sure what to do now. I ran some Fuel System Cleaner through the gas tank, and I think I&#8217;ll let the car warm up longer as well as pump up the tire pressure&#8230; then try one more time.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I took off the stock air box so I could stick on the universal K&amp;N filter. Due to hindsight, after taking everything apart, I realized the older Previas have a different MAF and it was not possible to mount a cone filter on to it without some sort of adapter. Luckily, the current air filter in the box isn&#8217;t too dirty, but I did waste my money buying the cone filter.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purchased Vehicle: $1250<\/li>\n<li>Smog Test (Failed): $31<\/li>\n<li>Coolant Leak Diagnosis: $10<\/li>\n<li>Coolant Pipe from Junkyard: $24 + $2 entrance fee<\/li>\n<li>Mobil 1 Oil: $27<\/li>\n<li>Oil Filter: $4<\/li>\n<li>Sea Foam: $9<\/li>\n<li>Wiper Blades: $28<\/li>\n<li>Bosch Upstream O2 Sensor: $78<\/li>\n<li>Bosch Downstream O2 Sensor: $50<\/li>\n<li>AC Delco Battery: $56<\/li>\n<li>Bumper Coating Paint: $4<\/li>\n<li>Work for Coolant Pipe and New Belts: $180<\/li>\n<li>NGK Iridium IX Spark Plugs: $29<\/li>\n<li>Direct-Fit Catalytic Converter: $154<\/li>\n<li>Magnaflow 5\u00d78 Race Muffler: $130<\/li>\n<li>BWD Spark Plug Wires: $49<\/li>\n<li>Floor Mats: $16<\/li>\n<li>Muffler Shop Work: $220<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I hate smog, but I don&#8217;t hate the environment&#8230; while that is contradictory, it&#8217;s still true.
