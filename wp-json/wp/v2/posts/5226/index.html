I take pride in doing most of my own work. I have a far greater degree of control and attention to detail when I&#8217;m doing everything myself. However, I simply do not have the bandwidth right now in life to undertake a massive engine and drivetrain project. I also do not have the facilities to complete the swap in my home garage in a timely fashion. Given the circumstances, I think relinquishing the car to a professional is the smart choice.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a shop I could be comfortable with was crucial. I had to use deliberation and careful examination of the options available before settling. From my experiences, many\u00a0automotive shops are subpar: busy, unorganized, filled with other customer cars, and with heavy emphasis on getting the job done with low refinement. There was no way I could trust leaving my car for a length of time at one of these shops. The higher end shops were either also too busy or wanted to charge exorbitant fees.<\/p>\n<p>After calling around, I was given a referral to a fabricator and mechanic named Marcus Fry, who branched off and started his own shop a year ago. After my initial conversation with him, I felt like he was a good match to hand off the project to and met my criteria: small, owner operated shop and was willing to dedicate the lift exclusively to my car until the swap was complete. I didn&#8217;t like the idea of having my car moved inside and outside while work was done simultaneously on other clients. Marcus was very accommodating and had all the right skills &#8211; there are several fabrication work I will need which he can do. I scheduled in the date with him to start the project and he came by to my house on July 6th to transport the LS3\/TR6060. It&#8217;s interesting that almost exactly 2 years ago was when <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/07\/project-rx-7\/\">I first received the car<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I then drove my car to his shop, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MFR.Fab\"><strong>Marcus Fry Racing Enterprises<\/strong><\/a>, and the swap was\u00a0in full motion.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/marcusfryracingenterprises.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5229\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/marcusfryracingenterprises.jpg\" alt=\"marcusfryracingenterprises\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Marcus allowed me to lend a hand to strip down the engine bay, which I thought was cool. I never worked on my own car in someone else&#8217;s shop before. Within a few hours, we were able to undo what was essentially 6 months of my work during the single turbo conversion.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/enginework.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5228\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/enginework.jpg\" alt=\"enginework\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The experience was slightly bittersweet seeing all my shiny, fresh single turbo parts being systematically ripped out. All I had to do was visualize the car with the V8 swap completed, and all notions of sadness were\u00a0immediately wiped away.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/strippedmotor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5231\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/strippedmotor.jpg\" alt=\"strippedmotor\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I collected the parts we removed and stepped out of the picture, leaving the rest of the project entirely to Marcus&#8217; capable hands. When I stopped by the next day to drop off a few more parts, I saw that the engine bay was bare.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/emptyenginebay.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5227\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/emptyenginebay.jpg\" alt=\"emptyenginebay\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Seeing the rotary powerplant outside of the car gives relativity on how truly <em>small<\/em> it is. The engine and transmission looked frail and undersized in juxtaposition to the far beefier LS3 and TR6060.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/motorpull.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5251\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/motorpull.jpg\" alt=\"motorpull\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/13brew.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5232\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/13brew.jpg\" alt=\"13brew\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Marcus also cleared out a bench near the back of the shop and organized all my swap parts there.
