I then placed the order immediately with Driveshaft Shop because the production is supposed to take 3 weeks. Conveniently, they actually finished it for me in a little over a week. Like all the other top-notch offerings from Driveshaft Shop, this one is no exception. It features a bolt-on CV joint adapter to the TR6060&#8217;s flange and then a universal joint at the 8.8 differential&#8217;s end. Incorporating a CV joint is more expensive, but features a higher range of adjustment with lower vibrations.<\/p>\n<p>The fuel lines were another item on the list that needed to be measured up and then custom ordered. There will be a total of 3 &#8220;flex&#8221; lines: 2 from the gas tank to the Wix fuel filter\/FPR and 1 from the fuel rail to the firewall bulkhead. The rest of the fuel system will be plumbed with a -6AN stainless steel hardline. I really wanted to overkill this area to eliminate any chance of fuel issues in the future, including fumes and having to smell gas in the garage.<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0picked the XRP HS-79 hose for the lines, which is aerospace quality and incorporates smooth-bore Teflon with a Kevlar composite construction. Unlike other hoses which can be assembled at home, these have to be machine crimped. Marcus made the measurements and I gave them to XRP to pre-make. The quality of the HS-79 is certainly reflected in its pricing. This unassuming box of 3 lines was close to $400!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/hs79.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5333\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/hs79.jpg\" alt=\"hs79\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the Wix filter with the stainless steel hardline routed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/rearfpr.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5337\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/rearfpr.jpg\" alt=\"rearfpr\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Marcus made this bracket to hold the bulkhead connector for the long section of the hardline.\u00a0Attention to detail &#8211; epitomized.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/bulkheadbracket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5330\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/bulkheadbracket.jpg\" alt=\"bulkheadbracket\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At the other end on the engine bay&#8217;s firewall, there is another bracket that holds together the fuel hardline and hardline for the rear brakes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/firewallbulkhead.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5331\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/firewallbulkhead.jpg\" alt=\"firewallbulkhead\" width=\"777\" height=\"1036\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The goal is to remove redundant wires and relays from the engine bay to have a clean, tucked install. A great deal of effort is obviously required for this portion. Marcus has been working on the wiring harness over the past week.
