I tried my hardest to keep going, but in the end, my better judgement won and I decided to close this chapter of my life. <\/p>\n<p>This decision could readily be derived from my most recent <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2011\/07\/metamorphosis\/\">track day experience<\/a>, and feeling burnt out from it. It was simply too time consuming and difficult to make the pilgrimage to the middle-of-nowhere and ride at triple digit speeds. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, riding at the track was amazing fun. When I first dragged my knee, I was instilled with the most captivating sense of badassery ever. <\/p>\n<p>But therein lies the catch: <strong><em>ONLY<\/strong><\/em> riding on the track is fun for me. Even though I went through all the work of converting my bike back to street mode, I found no enjoyment cruising around on the road. If you&#8217;ve ridden on the track before, then you will probably understand my perspective and I will not need to explain. If you have not&#8230; the reasoning is simple &#8211; you can&#8217;t really RIDE on the street. At least I can&#8217;t, because I&#8217;m not willing to risk ending up as a hood ornament on someone&#8217;s car. <\/p>\n<p>Along with my <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/01\/cholesterol-granuloma-experience-the-diagnosis\/\">recent ear troubles<\/a>, I was forced to pull the plug on my riding and take it easy. My fresh Dainese gear was sold and eventually my bike followed suit. A buyer came up all the way from San Diego to pick it up:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/cbr.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/cbr-620x463.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"cbr\" width=\"620\" height=\"463\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3413\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/cbr-620x463.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/cbr-800x597.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/cbr.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I might have shed a tear seeing the CBR loaded up and leaving me. A lot of work and money was invested into that bike, but there really was no point in keeping it. I wasn&#8217;t going to ride it on the street, and I don&#8217;t have the time or energy to track it anymore. Better to let someone else reap the rewards of my work than let the bike fade away by collecting dust. <\/p>\n<p>Following through with all of this was quite hard for me. Not only because I had to sell all my stuff, but because I was really only getting started with my riding career. There was much to progress and improve. Oh well, I&#8217;ll swallow my pride on this one&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Farewell Motorcycles, it has been a short but thrilling ride.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During this past Winter, I&#8217;ve had plenty of time to contemplate whether or not to keep up my riding or let it go.
