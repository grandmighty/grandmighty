Neither proved to be the solution, but still worth the try and good things to do regardless.<\/p>\n<p>The next logical step is to look deeper at the circuitry and determine the weak link at a more core level &#8211; the Mazda ignition wiring. Here&#8217;s the theory. The inadequacy of the Mazda ignition wiring creates a voltage drop that occasionally prevents the starter from activating. This is why I only get a click sound when turning the key, and I have to continually retry until it builds up enough to start. I never experienced the clicking when the car was rotary, but the GM starter draws far more amperage than the Mazda starter and I suspect is exceeding the limits of the wiring. <\/p>\n<p>Although this issue has never left me stranded and is somewhat infrequent&#8230; it is still annoying. And more importantly, it is a fault and must therefore be corrected. With all the work I&#8217;ve invested recently into the RX-7, I can say that I&#8217;ve grown rather weary. The easy way would be to raincheck the fix for another day down the road. However, laziness and procrastination are signs of a man who has yet to understand and consider the value of time. In other words, there will be no excuses, the problem gets addressed now.<\/p>\n<p>The solution: rewire the starter to include a &#8220;booster&#8221; relay. The concept follows the same exact mechanics as the <a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/2016\/02\/an-electrical-excursion\/\">fuel pump rewire<\/a> where the original power wire is diverted into a signal wire and the relay translates out a more direct source. Interestingly, Pettit sells this in a <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.pettitracing.com\/starter-booster-rx7-p-120110.html\">pre-made kit form<\/a>, which is essentially a generic relay with an instructions print out.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of spending $50 on their &#8220;kit&#8221;, I opted for the Do-It-Yourself route and spent $30 on a Waterproof 40A Hella Relay and Pigtail bundle. This relay is heavy duty and features 2 weatherpack seals.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6109\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6109\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"hellarelay\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/hellarelay.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>To start the install, I reunited with familiar friends&#8230; the jackstands and the soldering iron (the scissor jack is there only as a backup). <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6113\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6113\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands-777x583.jpg\" alt=\"onjackstands\" width=\"777\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands-777x583.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands-200x150.jpg 200w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands-400x300.jpg 400w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/onjackstands.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There was an ideal location to mount the relay on the passenger side of the engine near the oil pan and the starter.
