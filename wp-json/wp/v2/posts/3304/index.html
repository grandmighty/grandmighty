Okay, it first just died and then I&#8217;m pretty sure I blew it up. <\/p>\n<p>One day when I pushed the power button, it would start to boot up normally for the first couple of seconds and then recede back down to an idle. It doesn&#8217;t quite turn off, but it doesn&#8217;t fully boot either. My monitor has no connection and it never makes it to the BIOS screen. I thought the problem was either the power supply or the motherboard. Since the former is technically an easier fix, I went over to Best Buy today and bought a 600W Corsair power supply and hooked it up. I did the connections hastily because the chassis inside a computer is sharp as hell and I didn&#8217;t like messing with all the wires. I wasn&#8217;t really expecting it to work, anyway. When I went to power the computer back on, nothing was booting but this time there was an addition of an ominous burning smell lingering in the air. <\/p>\n<p>So&#8230; let&#8217;s just ignore all that and assume it was the motherboard. Yeah. I plucked out my hard drive and I&#8217;m going to dump this <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2011\/01\/workspace-part-2\/\">Gateway<\/a>. I guess 2 years is an adequate lifespan in the computer world. <\/p>\n<p>I should have more time and hopefully a new computer soon&#8230; and a great deal more content to talk about. Hopefully said content will be more interesting than a post about a dead PC, but no guarantees ;-)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I haven&#8217;t posted anything in almost 2 weeks, and as unacceptable as that is, I have a semi-legitimate excuse this time: my computer blew up.
