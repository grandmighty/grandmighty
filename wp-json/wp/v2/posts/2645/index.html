First introduced in the 2007 model year, the age of the bike is easily overlooked. People are typically used to new models being brought out between 3-4 years. Here is what looks to be the first picture of the new 2012 model&#8230; mostly just another color scheme change:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/2012cbr.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2646\" title=\"2012cbr\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/2012cbr-600x370.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/2012cbr-600x370.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/2012cbr.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Other than the colorway (which tributes back to the early 90s 600&#8217;s), major revisions include a patented Balance-Free Rear Shock, Big Piston Fork, and new LCD instrumentation. All in all, however, this is essentially still the same machine. The Supersport, middle-weight bikes in general have been relatively passive. Manufacturers have not implemented any of the fancy features of other classes, like traction control, to make 600&#8217;s more in tune with the times.<\/p>\n<p>With Honda going yet another year without a new redesign, at least my personal 2008 600RR is still up to date. Although I should be pleased, I honestly would have preferred for a new bike to have been released. I intend to ride my bike for a few more years regardless, but by then the used bike market would have been ripe for the picking.<\/p>\n<p>Which ever manufacturer steps up to introduce a completely new and innovative bike will also stand to reap the benefits of its associated competitive advantage. Most people interested in a 600cc bike probably already have one, and lack the necessity to change for a newer model. If Honda is going to take another year, I hope the 2013 600RR is something radically different. I personally am hoping for these features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>V-4!!! Enough Inlines already&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Dual Clutch Transmission like on the VFRs for seamless shifts and electronically blipped downshifts<\/li>\n<li>Underbody side-exhaust.
