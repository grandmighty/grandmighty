As a disclosure, <em>never<\/em> think for even a second your car build is done. You close one door and 5 more will open. That&#8217;s the thing with cars, there&#8217;s just too many things that need to be taken care of, it&#8217;s almost endless. And all those things cost money, lots and lots of money. My wallet hates me, and I&#8217;m pretty the UPS guy hates me too&#8230; the astronomical amount of packages I had delivered over the past few months have been more than my entire neighborhood combined.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not even the money that&#8217;s getting to me, even though this was supposed to be a budget-minded build and is now effectively voiding the classification I initially purposed&#8230; it&#8217;s the time and energy spent. Out of all people, I should have known what I signed up for in the beginning. I did, after all, sell my RX-7 to move away from cars. Yet somehow here I am again, buying parts and working on another car, all in the namesake of being able to drive something more unique. In order to properly undertake a build like this, you need to invest a monk&#8217;s level of diligence and patience.<\/p>\n<p>I have the diligence, maybe too much of it. When I take on a project with as much stake as this one, the need for thoroughness and perfection is compounded. However, given the nature of working on a car, things can go wrong far, far too easily. A horrible combination. I&#8217;m also lacking in the patience department, so instead, I have to tap into my stress reservoir to sustain myself. I&#8217;m already old as shit&#8230; after this build, I&#8217;ve aged myself at least another decade.<\/p>\n<p>With the second set of wheels, I had to get <em>another<\/em> alignment to dial in more camber. I&#8217;ve also had to tweak the coilover heights at least a million god damn times. From those million adjustments, I had to mount and dismount the wheels each time. While unscrewing the lugnuts, my socket dropped and put a small ding on one of the wheels. Then it happened again, this time on the other side with the lugnut itself dropping. I had to shave and grind for clearance around the passenger side bumper\/fender probably half a million times. That passenger front wheel also ended up bending out the fender&#8230; and in a moment of haste, I thought hitting it with a hammer would fix it. It didn&#8217;t. Now I have a front fender that&#8217;s not only bent, but dented.<\/p>\n<p>These are all but minor examples. Every little thing adds a tally to my neurosis. Everything wouldn&#8217;t matter if this car was <em>at least<\/em> a few thousand dollars cheaper, but it&#8217;s been blown out of proportion.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t really say if this car was worth it, because I haven&#8217;t been able to enjoy it. We&#8217;ll see in the time to come. But take my word for it, I won&#8217;t be building another stupid car after this. This one has taken a toll on me, and I have the popped blood vessels to prove it.<\/p>\n<p>Most of all, I need to tell myself to NOT SELL THIS and KEEP IT. I have a very bad habit of building something, getting bored of it, and selling it all too soon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;m starting to lose my grip with this whole project.
