These hoodliners are prone to becoming brittle and breaking apart, so it was more worthwhile to find a better solution. Instead, I bought a 48&#8243;x24&#8243; sheet of reflective heat barrier. After a few careful measurements and transpositions, I cut out 2 holes in the heat barrier for the vents.<\/p>\n<p>Once applied to the hood, I used gold reflective tape for bordering. It took me 3 weeks to finally finish this heat shield because I kept running out of gold tape. I ended up using 3 separate rolls to complete the job. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/hoodheatshield.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/hoodheatshield-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"hoodheatshield\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4860\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/hoodheatshield-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/hoodheatshield-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/hoodheatshield.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the hood freshly repainted, for the third time, I wanted to take additional measures to protect it from engine heat.
