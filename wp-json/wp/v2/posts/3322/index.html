And yes, I sold the <a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/1series.jpg\">BMW<\/a>. Before you cast me off as a nutcase, give me a moment to explain. I always like to defend my own actions and elaborate on what my thought processes are. Relating back to the subject matter touched upon in <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2012\/03\/swedish-thinking\/\">this post<\/a>, I began to question my reasoning for owning the BMW. It wasn&#8217;t considered a very high-end or expensive car (of the caliber of M3&#8217;s, for example), nor was it cheap. It was positioned in that awkward middle ground. As nice as the BMW was, I honestly couldn&#8217;t care less what kind of status, if any, it brought me. <\/p>\n<p>Since I couldn&#8217;t quite justify owning the BMW, I decided I had my fun and ended up selling it. My intent was to embrace the philosophy of less being more, and &#8220;downsized&#8221; to a Fiat 500. This was my first time shopping for a brand new car. I checked out a few other makes, but in the end, the quirkiness and practicality of the Fiat won me over. Granted it&#8217;s a tiny car and severely underpowered, but at least it&#8217;s still stick shift and surprisingly fun to drive. A great get-in-and-go car and I&#8217;m enjoying it. Having a car with a big engine is only enablement to drive like a total asshole. Which can be a good thing, but is mostly bad. This little Fiat gets 30\/38 MPG&#8230; versus the 19-20 MPG I was averaging with the BMW. <\/p>\n<p>Another change is the fact that I&#8217;m locked in with this car&#8230; I&#8217;m on a 36 month lease with it so I&#8217;ll have to hold my habit of changing cars all the time. In the past 6 or so years, I&#8217;ve been through 9 cars. This will be a welcomed change of pace. <\/p>\n<p>How small is small with this car? Well, I now wish I didn&#8217;t get a Sunroof because my head is literally at the ceiling even with the seat all the way down. You can still cram in 2 people in the rear, albeit uncomfortably. This 2+2 seating arrangement comes at the sacrifice of luggage space, which is just big enough to fit a 330mm Nardi Steering wheel.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/nardi.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/nardi-620x829.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"nardi\" width=\"620\" height=\"829\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3325\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/nardi-620x829.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/nardi.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In case you&#8217;re suspecting, I&#8217;m not quite as shameless as you think&#8230; I didn&#8217;t step down to this Fiat without also taking a step up somewhere else.
