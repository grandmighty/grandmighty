I read about people just putting the bike into first gear and using the transmission to loosen the front sprocket nut. I&#8217;m not down with the idea of putting that much stress on important drive train parts, so with the bar method, all the stress is put naturally onto the chain.<\/p>\n<p>Once that was taken care of, it was time to get rid of the stock chain.

These were also the United Kingdom made Dunlops, not the US ones. After the Dunlops were put on, I drove over to Dublin to return the Pirellis, and found him in his garage just as I pulled up.
