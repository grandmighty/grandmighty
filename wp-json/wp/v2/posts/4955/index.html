The quote they gave me to do the work was significantly more than other alternatives, but I felt most comfortable having them take it on. I had the dash wrapped in genuine black Alcantara. This is when I came to learn just how pricey the fabric can be (over $100 a yard).<\/p>\n<p>Frugality notwithstanding, I figured attempting a task as daring as rewrapping a dash would benefit from the investment in high-end materials and workmanship. The job took a couple of weeks to complete. In the process, Bascom repaired and reinforced the broken glovebox mounting points on the plastics. I also asked them to permanently affix the defroster vents from the backside, since they have a tendency to lift up at the edges over time.<\/p>\n<p>Since the days of my initial foray into the car world, I&#8217;ve always dreamed about having an Alcantara interior. I&#8217;m not sure what influenced and anchored the thought, but the material seems so fitting for a sports car. Now almost a decade later, I finally have the chance to fully pursue it. <\/p>\n<p>Once the rewrap was complete, I dedicated an evening putting everything back together. This included mounting on the powder coated crossmember, installing the numerous HVAC ducts, and routing in the wiring harness. Since I reused my original &#8217;94 harness, I had to get a little creative with it and ended up relocating 2 ground points. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantaradash.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantaradash-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"alcantaradash\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4957\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantaradash-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantaradash-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantaradash.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashducts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashducts-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"dashducts\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4958\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashducts-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashducts-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashducts.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I also spent WAY too much time than I should have figuring out the VIN plate&#8217;s reattachment. The wide flanged, black rivets Mazda used to secure them are an odd size. Bascom initially used black rivets that were close in size, but still didn&#8217;t cover up holes adequately. I had them removed and decided to install the plate with stainless steel rivets and washers, which covered up the holes and looks quite good. Additionally, I noticed a pair of small blemishes appeared on the plate, likely from being handled at Bascom. It was unfortunate, but I was able to touch them up with a small brush and brown paint. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantara.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantara-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"alcantara\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4956\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantara-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantara-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/alcantara.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Due to the dash&#8217;s compound curves, Bascom incorporated a seam above the glovebox area to create a joint in the material. Keeping in theme with the rest of the interior, I requested the stitching be done in black. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashstitching.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashstitching-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"dashstitching\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4960\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashstitching-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashstitching-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashstitching.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Finally, the dash was shoved back into place inside the car and bolted down. It was quite refreshing to see the &#8217;93 dash installed and the added simplicity it ushered&#8230; the passenger side airbag is a sight that will not be missed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/suededash.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/suededash-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"suededash\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4961\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/suededash-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/suededash-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/suededash.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashrewrap.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashrewrap-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"dashrewrap\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4959\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashrewrap-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashrewrap-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/dashrewrap.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I never really planned to tackle the interior in such a grandiose fashion, however, the cheapness of it started to add up for me. The RX-7 is an amazing car with many strengths and Mazda did a great job engineering most of its features &#8211; except the interior. In their ambition to keep the car as light as possible, they skimped in an area that deserved it the least&#8230; now the car is plighted by cheap, thin plastics inside. I think the aesthetics and ergonomics of the interior are excellent, but the FEEL is not. Everything I&#8217;m doing now is to help enhance the feel department and raise the overall quality inside. I understand that the foundation may be imperfect, so there is only so much I can do. Even rewrapping the dash is essentially a &#8220;best effort&#8221; solution. Regardless, an improvement of any magnitude is still an improvement.<\/p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, the car&#8217;s interior is coming back together. I am eager to install the remaining pieces once they are ready. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the dash removed from the car and completely stripped down, I brought it over to Bascom Trim and Upholstery in Santa Clara.
