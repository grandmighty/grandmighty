In my search for the best fitting and most proper gear, I&#8217;m yet again going through some changes. I recently sold my AGV GP-Tech helmet because \u00a0the Rossi scheme became a bit too flashy for me. It was a great helmet and fit me fine, but I&#8217;m too slow to be able to wear the 46 number and not look like a poser. Secondly, I sold my Sidi Vertigo boots. When I was trying on boots at the store previously, I was under the impression that tighter was better. That is not so. I went way too tight with the Sidi&#8217;s, and they gave me much discomfort during the Trackday last weekend. By the afternoon, I couldn&#8217;t even feel my feet since they went completely numb. It sucked to say the least, so I had to sell them. I was also able to unload a RS-Taichi RSJ826 jacket, since I don&#8217;t ride on the street often and had no use for it. With RS-Taichi being a Japanese brand, it was of good quality&#8230; but my tastes still lean towards Dainese as my favorite.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I now had to find a replacement for the Sidi&#8217;s. After looking at some Dainese boots online, I knew they were what I wanted. Today, I journeyed into San Francisco (cliffnotes: gloomy weather, city driving sucks) to pay a visit to the Dainese D-Store on South Van Ness and buy some boots directly. No dealers really carried any of the newer Dainese boots, and neither did Dainese warehouses, but the D-Store luckily had a few of them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/dainesestore.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-298\" title=\"dainesestore\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/dainesestore-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/dainesestore-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/dainesestore.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cool store, it was Dainese heaven inside. I spent extra time trying on and retrying different boots and sizes to make sure I&#8217;d get the right ones this time. The Sidi&#8217;s I had were a size 41 Euro, which were the absolute smallest I could fit in, and proved to be far too snug over time. After trying on some 42&#8217;s this time, they were perfect. A small amount of heel lift, and they were snug (but not too snug).<\/p>\n<p>I originally wanted the Dainese Axial Race boots, but in person they weren&#8217;t so flattering. Quite plain and generic for such an expensive boot. Then I turned my attention to the new Torque Pro&#8217;s, and they fit much better and looked to be made better as well. Not to mention they were a bit cheaper.<\/p>\n<p>A successful trip, and I now proudly have some very awesome boots.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/torquepro.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-299\" title=\"torquepro\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/torquepro-590x393.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/torquepro-590x393.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/torquepro.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Call me fickle, because I can&#8217;t completely deny it.
