Okay, so I like to indulge sometimes&#8230; but I saw this as an applicable necessity. I first got into photography back in high school, which started with a Nikon D50 and a 50mm f\/1.8 lens. I had that for a while and then sold the D50, got a D90, and put the 50mm on that. I later sold the D90 with the lens. Now about a year has passed, and I decided to get back into it. This time I&#8217;m crossing over to Canon. I love Nikon&#8217;s build feel in the body and their metering systems, but they&#8217;ve been behind recently. I waited for something new to come out, like a new D90 replacement (since it&#8217;s video shooting ability sucks)&#8230; but no news. Then Canon comes out with the 550D\/T2i, which shares the sensor from the 7D. On top of that, the 550D has fleshed out video capture features that include full 1080 HD, and different FPS&#8217;s from 24,30, and up to 60.<\/p>\n<p>It was just what I was looking for, not to mention being that it&#8217;s a Rebel, cheaper. I didn&#8217;t want to spend $2,000+ on a camera, which I will explain why in the next post.<\/p>\n<p>The list of all the different components I wanted with the camera ended up being fairly large&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0260.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-158\" title=\"IMG_0260\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0260-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0260-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0260.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The camera unpacked:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0261.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-159\" title=\"IMG_0261\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0261-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0261-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0261.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0262.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-160\" title=\"IMG_0262\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0262-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0262-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0262.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Admittedly, the plastics on the camera aren&#8217;t as solid feeling, in my opinion, as Nikon&#8217;s. However, I had a solution in the form of the Delkin Snug-It Pro cover. Not only does it protect the camera, it makes it feel more sturdy and adds grip. Unfortunately, getting it to work in conjunction with the battery grip wasn&#8217;t plug and play. With the Snug-It on, the battery grip can&#8217;t lock in flush with the bottom of the camera, so the terminals aren&#8217;t making full contact; which,\u00a0evidentially, doesn&#8217;t allow the camera to turn on. I had to trim around the bottom of the Snug-It to give more clearance so the battery grip can sit in all the way. Also, the the cover had a weird flap that went over the hot shoe. I thought that was useless and finicky so I cut it off.<\/p>\n<p>Here is everything assembled. I&#8217;m using a 50mm f\/1.8 prime lens again, to keep it with tradition so to speak.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0263.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-161\" title=\"IMG_0263\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0263-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0263-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/IMG_0263.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I wanted to try it out, and what better subject than my bike.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-156\" title=\"ducati\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati-590x352.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati-590x352.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati-1024x611.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-157\" title=\"ducati2\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati2-590x393.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati2-590x393.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/ducati2.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I guess you could say this is another &#8220;gift&#8221; for myself.
