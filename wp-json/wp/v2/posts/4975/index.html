Aside from eBay, the majority of offerings are out of production and no longer available from their respective manufacturers. <\/p>\n<p>C&#8217;s is one maker I&#8217;m especially keen on, but given that the company itself is now out of business, it&#8217;s safe to assume their RX-7 shifter is DEFINITELY no longer available. While a shifter is relatively basic in its mechanics, quality and detail can still be appreciated. C&#8217;s specialized in making short shifters and held a reputation for high caliber construction. <\/p>\n<p>The stock shifter is already nice, which is basically what the installed RE-Amemiya shifter was, so I wanted a shifter that wouldn&#8217;t depreciate the feel by being overly notchy or stubborn to work. The general consensus from users who have trialled multiple shifters is that the C&#8217;s offered the best refinement. Of course, this is all subjective, but was a positive notion nonetheless. <\/p>\n<p>I sent over a candid email to a contact (same guy who sold me the RX-7 in the first place), who is known to have stockpiles of random RX-7 parts, and inquired on a short shifter. By a stroke of luck, he happened to be in the middle of a part-out on a car that conveniently had a C&#8217;s. I jumped on it, of course, since this was a rare chance for me to try one of these shifters.<\/p>\n<p>Here are all the parts laid out after cleaning. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshifter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshifter-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"csshifter\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4976\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshifter-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshifter-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshifter.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The brand of authenticity:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshortshifter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshortshifter-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"csshortshifter\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4977\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshortshifter-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshortshifter-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/csshortshifter.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the C&#8217;s juxtaposed with the RE-Amemiya short shifter. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s accurate to call the latter a short shifter. As depicted in the picture below, the &#8220;arm&#8221; of the shifters are different lengths. The C&#8217;s has a longer arm, which raises the fulcrum. The RE-Amemiya is the same as a stock shifter, only the top portion, where the shift knob threads in, has been lowered&#8230; <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/shortshifters.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/shortshifters-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"shortshifters\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4979\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/shortshifters-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/shortshifters-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/shortshifters.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Installation was easy and straight forward.
