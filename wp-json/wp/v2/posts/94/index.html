Whenever I saw a bike I&#8217;d admire it. I&#8217;ve been a shadow admirer for a while, but I never mustered up the courage or took any steps to get one. Finally, last month, everything felt right and I decided the time had arrived and it was my turn to ride. \u00a0I signed up for a MSF safety course and went through the whole (boring) process towards my M1 license. Convincing the parents took a combination of persistence and good timing&#8230; they knew I was\u00a0committed.\u00a0\u00a0I had been riding bicycles for about 2 years prior to this point. The whole tight spandex wearing, constant and sweaty pedaling in mostly straight lines was starting to wear off on me. At least it was a good stepping stone, if not to only make me more aware of traffic elements as a rider.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward a few more weeks, my license was slowly coming into the mail from the DMV&#8230; and I had ordered up some gear. The time came to obtain an actual bike. After looking around at Japanese brand motorcycles, I wasn&#8217;t particularly impressed by them. Their build quality, looks, and that 4-cylinder engine note didn&#8217;t appeal to me. I initially wanted a Triumph 675 Daytona, and then started looking into Ducati 746&#8217;s. A bit of deliberation later, it was down to a red 746&#8230; and this white 2008 848. The latter was significantly higher priced, but it was without a doubt a better bike. While the 848 was at a far higher league than what I was initially looking for, I knew that it was the one I wanted. I pulled out literally almost all of my savings at the time and went out and bought it. A risky choice at the time, but there is no regrets. Especially because it&#8217;s so beautiful, and I keep finding myself making trips into the garage just to look at it. :D<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the machine that I essentially sold my car for (car was sold after):<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/ducati848.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" title=\"ducati848\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/ducati848-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/ducati848-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/ducati848.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I remember the first ride was fairly intimidating. I just got on and went around the neighborhood, but when I realized just how much torque the bike had&#8230; I had a moment where I thought I really got myself in too far. This might be attributed to my OCD, I couldn&#8217;t claim to bike to be mine unless I cleaned\/detailed it.<\/p>\n<p>So it was into the garage, and off with the fairings:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/garage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" title=\"garage\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/garage-590x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/garage-590x351.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/garage.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I did what I could and gave everything a good scrub underneath, and then put the fairings back on. Next came a claybar of the exterior followed by some polish and wax.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it was time to actually ride it, so after lunch the next day I hopped on and went out into the streets for the first time. The stopping and going took some getting used to, but I felt relatively comfortable afterwards. The day after that I decided to try out the local twisties, and I now hope to keep developing my skills on the bike and eventually attend a track day.<\/p>\n<p>After reaching this point, and riding the Ducati&#8230; I firmly believe that I&#8217;m not going to want a fancy sports car anymore. The thrill of riding and the freedom that entails it is\u00a0incomparable\u00a0by sitting inside a metal box with 4 wheels. The sense of turning and cornering just doesn&#8217;t feel as fun. Driving a motorcycle is very highly dependent on the rider and his skill. You turn by shifting your weight and making the bike lean with you, its so much more connected. I can&#8217;t say the same thing about turning a steering wheel while sitting upright in a car, however&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Motorcycles have always had a place in my heart, but before it was more or less feelings of awe and fascination.
