Salvage titled and repainted. Overall just a rough, cheap car. It did get me places for a while, but I soon got tired of it. I bought as is:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/yellowmiata.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1873\" title=\"yellowmiata\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/yellowmiata-600x398.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/yellowmiata-600x398.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/yellowmiata.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t hang with the yellow color&#8230; very bad idea.

It seemed like an obvious choice over the S14. I refined my philosophy and knew that at the root, my ideal car is a simple one. A Miata has all the qualities of a raw and crude car, but with modern touches. The pop-up headlights also sealed the deal. Plus, I like the idea of owning a more controversial type of car. I have, after all, been driving a Prius.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, definitely looking forward to the stuff ahead with this particular Miata, because I finally own a clean, not-crappy one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Technically speaking, I&#8217;m on my third Miata.
