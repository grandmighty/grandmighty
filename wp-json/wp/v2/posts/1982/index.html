Didn&#8217;t take any pictures, because it basically looks as it did before&#8230; except shinier and smoother. This repaint was a big decision to make, but at least it has been made. I did in fact get it painted at a Maaco&#8230; it&#8217;s funny because I used to be a bandwagoner and knocked Maaco paint jobs. Why Maaco? I got quotes from a couple other shops in the area, and they were quoting me 4-6k for a repaint&#8230; on a Miata. Secondly, Maacos are individually owned and essentially are like any other shop. I did some research beforehand and the particular Maaco in Fremont on South Grimmer seemed to have higher standards. Trust me, I&#8217;ve tried regular, independent body shops in the past&#8230; and had plenty awful experiences regardless. No body shop will give you a perfect paint job, no matter how much you pay. Plus, repainting the same gloss black color shouldn&#8217;t be rocket science. I thought about doing a metallic black, \u00a0but opted out&#8230; I think black looks best when it is just that, black.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Maaco&#8217;s reputation really takes a hit simply from their willingness to paint a car for $500. It&#8217;s unfortunate that the franchise offers such cheap packages as it really brings down the image. Obviously if you pay $500 for a full repaint, it&#8217;ll be crap (especially if a color change is involved).<\/p>\n<p>My priority out of this was to get the dents out and to fix the front and rear bumpers. Having fresh paint all around didn&#8217;t hurt. Unlike most others who go to Maaco, I shelled out for their high-end Signature series paint, which is PPG brand based and 2 stage. I did have them take off as much stuff as possible for the prep &#8211; \u00a0like the tail lights, door handles, etc. Also, since the car came with ugly, bumpy rock guard material along the sides, I took the opportunity to get them all smoothed out.\u00a0This paint job was definitely not cheap and I had to sacrifice the Previa for it. I sold the van a couple weeks ago and the cash went straight into the paint job.<\/p>\n<p>In the end the car turned out pretty nice&#8230; not extraordinary but very presentable (then again, my neuroticism and pickiness are renowned). Some of the\u00a0moldings\u00a0are a bit off due to their reinstallation so I&#8217;ll have to take care of those&#8230; They did cut and buff the large panels of the car, but another phase needs to be done in about a month. The paint is too new and not cured enough to do any serious wetsanding.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, I finally have the car back and can start getting to work on it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I picked the car up today after exactly 3 weeks at the body shop.
