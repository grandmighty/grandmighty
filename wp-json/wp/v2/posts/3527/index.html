While unmatchably thrilling, motorcycle riding is also grossly more dangerous which shifts the payout bias negatively. In my experiences of tracking my bike, I encountered individuals who would go to the track up to a dozen times a year. And they were doing it simply because they wanted to, not to race professionally. That requires a ton of effort and a lot to be put on the line&#8230; all for virtually no visibility\/glory.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m much more comfortable resorting back to cars. It may be easier, but sometimes a lower difficulty is necessary in order to really have fun. It&#8217;s less stress because there&#8217;s less you have to worry about, and that&#8217;s important.<\/p>\n<p>I was watching this video of some guy pulling out of his driveway to go on a ride, and then T-bones a car not even a minute later. Conveniently, he came equipped with enough cameras to shoot a Hollywood production. I&#8217;m not sure why the video needed to be 14 minutes in length, but you get to see everything in detail. <\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7VLnnCIX_OQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>It is quite disenchanting to see how quickly things can go horribly wrong on a bike. An Asian, female, teenage driver (just stating the facts from the video&#8230;) makes a U-turn without bothering to even look, and this rider ends up with a broken femur. At 2:58 the girl tries to cast blame away and makes an infuriating comment, &#8220;Did you just not see me?&#8221; Yup, humanity is doomed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whenever I&#8217;m going along in traffic during my commutes, I&#8217;m always surveying motorcyclists as they buzz by.
