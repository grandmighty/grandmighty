Well, I think I may be going through withdrawals and I can&#8217;t hide it anymore&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>My cursed pattern has been to work and build on something, and then sell it. I should have kept the RX-7. I should have kept the <a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/category\/projects\/miata\/\">Miata<\/a>. I should have kept the <a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/category\/projects\/cbr600rr\/\">CBR<\/a>. In a Utopian world, I would have unlimited funds and storage space. Unfortunately, this is not the case, which is why I have been forced to sell and sell. I just don&#8217;t have the capacity to hold onto something that is deemed unnecessary or superfluous. Maybe this stems from my inherently minimalistic nature.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever it is, I need to break the chain. I need to STICK with one thing. Although my past projects and endeavors have lost me substantial amounts of money, they at least gained me one invaluable essential &#8211; experience. <\/p>\n<p>I know I go through ups and downs. Right now I&#8217;m in an old-man stage. I think modifying a car is pointless and that European cars are superior. While adult in mindset, I am starting to feel that being wise and making the &#8220;right&#8221; choice isn&#8217;t always the funnest path. I&#8217;m getting old fast, but I will have plenty of time to be &#8220;old&#8221; later. <\/p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/2012\/06\/stepping-out-of-the-motorcycle-game\/\">stopped riding<\/a> and don&#8217;t have a bike anymore, so what hobby or toy do I really have now? I have the Mini, but that&#8217;s more of a collectible for me more than anything. If I really want to drive a car, I&#8217;m still a man that likes precision&#8230; and big 6-pot brakes. And then I have the Fiat (*facepalm*). How low I have stooped. What am I going to do now&#8230; fuck it, might as well try fishing or something. <\/p>\n<p>Or I can go back to my dirty roots. Which is what my instincts have been yearning for lately. I&#8217;m talking about being a ricer again. I have no shame in it, because I am simply not high-strung enough to drive around in a fancy luxury car. I have very particular tastes and I like working on projects. Although wrenching is very taxing and difficult at times, I ultimately see it as a challenging puzzle.<\/p>\n<p>I can lose my motivation for cars and I can publicly discard all the work I&#8217;ve done to them, but one fact is certain &#8211; I will never be able to kick the habit. Might as well embrace it&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>Check out Ken from <a href=\"http:\/\/shineautoproject.com\">Shine Auto Project<\/a>&#8216;s RX-7, with a recent addition of Desmond Marquis Promadas (Macdaddy Regamasters) on A048&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/581333_3863099576376_1245063467_33770644_996786585_n.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/581333_3863099576376_1245063467_33770644_996786585_n-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"581333_3863099576376_1245063467_33770644_996786585_n\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3419\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/581333_3863099576376_1245063467_33770644_996786585_n-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/581333_3863099576376_1245063467_33770644_996786585_n.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Looking at that car gives me bad thoughts. I&#8217;ve been tossing around the idea of starting a strictly track drift car, a la a 240SX Coupe with a TRA Kyoto 6666 kit&#8230; but if my lesson from Motorcycles has taught me anything, it&#8217;s that a track-only vehicle will not be used frequently. I doubt I&#8217;d be able to go to the track that often. Plus, Mr. <a href=\"http:\/\/freshlove.grandmighty.com\">Freshlove<\/a> expertly noted that a grip car is more useful and adaptable than a drift-only car. <\/p>\n<p>With that said, I think a &#8220;cool&#8221; street car would be my best bet. The <strong><em>KEY<\/strong><\/em> here is to get a car that I can drive routinely. The less I am able to use something&#8230; the more likely I&#8217;ll sell it. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just thinking aloud here. I have no idea what is going to happen or what direction I&#8217;ll take.
