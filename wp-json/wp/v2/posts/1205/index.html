Building a computer on your own to the same specs would surely be much more expensive.<\/p>\n<p>On top of Gateway&#8217;s already budget friendly prices, I bought my particular PC refurbished off of eBay. I think it was around $500. I changed out the power supply with a slightly bigger one I had laying around, and added in a couple more gigs of RAM.
