For the past 2 months, I&#8217;ve invested much time and energy dutifully searching for a specific car. Now I&#8217;ve come to an acceptance of a very stark reality &#8211; finding said car may not actually be a possibility. This isn&#8217;t saying I&#8217;m giving up, but rather I&#8217;ve come to terms with the balance of Chance.<\/p>\n<p>Why am I even looking for this car? I indeed remember shunning cars in favor of motorcycles, but as time went by, I started to reassess. Sure, there are not many options in this Earthly existence that offer the same level of thrill that motorcycles do, but given how little I rode them on the street, it&#8217;s evident their place for me is purely at the track. Call me lazy, but I found it too inconvenient to have to gear up for every ride. Which is how I find it hard to understand why certain people lionize their &#8220;year-round&#8221; motorcycle riding. So you have the audacity to bear cold weather compounded by wind and rain, I&#8217;m assuming this garners universal admiration? For me, I lack that spirit, but I think mentality is a better word. If I have to go to run errands, I would much rather just jump in a car and go. I&#8217;m shielded from the elements and I can listen to the radio&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I drive a Toyota Prius on an almost a daily basis, so you can see where I&#8217;m going with this. I&#8217;m not hating on the Prius because it is in fact super useful, and only a fool would complain about a 50 MPG average. But eventually you just gotta have something funner, something raw&#8230; Same idea applies to any day-to-day type of car, stereotypical Prius or not.<\/p>\n<p>Since I can&#8217;t go to the track everyday to ride, I need an alternative for the vast expanse of days in between. In other words, the car I&#8217;m looking for will be in interest of maintaining my sanity. I also grew up being into cars, so I can&#8217;t abandon my roots, as one would say.<\/p>\n<p>With all that, the question looms&#8230; what is this car I&#8217;m looking for exactly? Following my reasoning behind the sale of the RX-7 and Ducati, it won&#8217;t be too expensive. Plain and simple, you can&#8217;t make full use of something when it costs a ton of money. Plus, I&#8217;m not about the whole &#8220;image&#8221; a car brings you. Buying a fancy new Mercedes to display your status is totally meaningless, in my opinion. You are not what you buy. I admire the ideal of \u00a0being &#8220;built, not bought,&#8221; and am looking forward to wrench-turning.<\/p>\n<p>There may be a seemingly endless amount of cars out there, but when it comes down to it, there are very few I&#8217;d actually want to own. To be more specific, I&#8217;m looking for a car that is rear wheel drive, sporty, reliable, light weight, easy to maintain, and has widely available parts. Sounds like another mass-produced Japanese car from the 90&#8217;s to me. Then the choice becomes filtered down further with personal tastes and inclinations. I&#8217;ve taken delicate consideration with this choice, however. Unlike the RX-7, for example, where I thought it was awesome because it was rare and aesthetically appealing, etc&#8230; only to realize the engine was like a time-bomb.<\/p>\n<p>So why is this car so hard to find, when on paper it should be easy? To my dismay, everything I find is either bastardized with a retarded body kit by an inconsiderate teenager, or on the verge of imploding from extreme neglect. I am also picky. If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned, it&#8217;s the absolute necessity to buy what you are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t do much, other than keep searching&#8230; figured I&#8217;d at least make a post about it rather than keep it implicit &#8211; potentially indefinitely. Now I can bring in new content on a few of the parts I&#8217;ve been&#8230; collecting. It will be a grand day when this car comes to full fruition, if such a fate is not destined, then it will be a grand lesson in humility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;m not usually the type of person that likes to prematurely announce things before they&#8217;re even in my possession, but I will in this case due to opposing circumstances.
