This is why I like to do my own work, the level of control is unrivaled. I simply don&#8217;t think even paying a shop can yield better results in this respect. <\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m trying to buy a car, the first thing I examine and attempt to construe is the maintenance history and who did the work. If the car was modified, then this point becomes compounded and is especially crucial. If I see that some kid in his teens or early twenties did everything at home, that&#8217;s an immediate red flag and I will run for the hills. On the other hand, I would probably buy a car from myself &#8211; or at least my mindset is geared towards this intention.<\/p>\n<p>The most ideal candidate for a previous owner is someone who has a combination of neuroticism and experience. It&#8217;s safe to say that I can get extremely OCD with my cars. And looking back, I haven&#8217;t put down the wrench for even one year since I was 16&#8230; I was always working on something, whether it was a car or a bike. It&#8217;s this experience that has lead me to where I am today with the RX-7.  <\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m trying to rationalize here is that there should be a high level of detail and workmanship manifested throughout a build or project. This is the goal, but the question is, how many people and cars out there actually hit the mark? Very few&#8230; Those that do fall into the category should be regarded differently and you&#8217;re more likely to find a worthwhile product here. Everything else simply becomes average. <\/p>\n<p>Ranting aside, I&#8217;d like to showcase a few items of interest. <\/p>\n<p>For the manifold studs, instead of reusing the stock nuts that bite into the threads, I opted for these copper locking nuts. I&#8217;m also using these locking nuts on the exhaust flanges. The hex of the nuts is 14mm, a convenient trait, albeit with so many USA made parts on the car it becomes a futile battle to keep everything synchronized with metric sizes. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/copperlocknuts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/copperlocknuts-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"copperlocknuts\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4537\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/copperlocknuts-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/copperlocknuts-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/copperlocknuts.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Accompanying the copper locking nuts, I used a touch of super high temperature anti-seize to fend off corrosion and aid in removal. This stuff can withstand temperatures up to 3000* Fahrenheit.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/antiseize.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/antiseize-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"antiseize\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4536\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/antiseize-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/antiseize-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/antiseize.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Zip ties, although frequently used, tend to be overlooked. I decided to step up the quality of zip ties I used from generic brands to Thomas &#038; Betts. These have a stainless steel locking prong and gain a higher tensile strength &#8211; I highly recommend them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/thomasbetts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/thomasbetts.jpg\" alt=\"thomasbetts\" width=\"777\" height=\"1166\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4539\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The subject of splicing electrical wires together in an automotive environment is a debated one: solder or crimp? Soldering, when done right, is great for establishing a connection with low resistance. However, it is brittle and can be prone to fracturing from vibrations, thus giving the crimping an edge in versatility. <\/p>\n<p>After weighing the pros and cons of both methods, I ended up choosing to combine BOTH. I made a trip to a local Fastenal and picked up these sealed crimp and solder connectors. They&#8217;re expensive, but allow you to first crimp together two wires and then flow in solder by heating the center section. Best of both worlds. I used these connectors for the fuel pump rewire and to extend the radiator fan&#8217;s wiring. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/crimpsolder.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/crimpsolder-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"crimpsolder\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4538\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/crimpsolder-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/crimpsolder-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/crimpsolder.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I drained the gas tank in order to introduce fresh &#8217;91 Chevron and start the premix diet anew. Mazda actually included a drain plug at the bottom of the gas tank, how cool is that. All it takes is a 17mm wrench and you&#8217;re done&#8230; no need to mess with siphons or anything silly. I also flushed the old coolant that was in the block to start flushing the coolant system. <\/p>\n<p>When it was time to seal the gas tank and block back up, I bought new bolts and crush washers from Mazda to complete the job. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/drainplugs.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/drainplugs-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"drainplugs\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4547\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/drainplugs-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/drainplugs-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/drainplugs.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Left to right: gas tank; center iron (coolant); differential fill and drain plugs; and a pair of new crush washers for the oil pan.
