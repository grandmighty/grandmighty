It was windy yesterday night, and consistently throughout today as well. Met a fair amount of headwind riding there, but that meant the other direction was super easy. I did a loop around the back again, then decided to find something new. There was another trail further down the road from the entrance to the park, and that went out into the marshlands. The pavement eventually ended at this boat that ran aground. Since this seemed like a popular photo op for people that come out here, I decided to indulge as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/christinamaria.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-421\" title=\"christinamaria\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/christinamaria-590x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/christinamaria-590x442.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/christinamaria.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/abandonedboat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-420\" title=\"abandonedboat\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/abandonedboat-590x786.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/abandonedboat-590x786.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/abandonedboat.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Pretty fun ride, but I noticed at the very start there was some sort of clicking\/creaking sound from my bike. It only really happened when I pedaled hard or slalomed. The sound seemed like it was coming from the rear, but I&#8217;m pretty certain it&#8217;s from the seatpost. It doesn&#8217;t happen when I&#8217;m off the saddle. So, I got some grease made for carbon seat posts, and oiled up everything around the seat rails. Hopefully that should do something.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Woke up this morning and went to Coyote Hills again.
