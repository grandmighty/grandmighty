I would rage over Tsukuba lap-times and goggle at how much of a work of art BBS wheels were. As shameful as it is to admit this, I even bought a fanboy Nismo t-shirt and even a Z hat when I had a 300zx. In my defense, I was 16-18 at the time. Looking back, those were definitely some ignorant, cruel days. Another thing I thought was cool was going to &#8220;meets&#8221; and car shows. Or in other words, drive out to a random parking lot, park, and talk to random strangers (99.9% males, with the .1% being males who were really females underneath). Yeah man, those were the days. I can&#8217;t wait to stand in a parking lot all day looking at sweet rides.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to go to less and less of these things over time. As <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2010\/06\/my-old-rx-7\/\">I mentioned earlier<\/a> about how vain the car culture really is, I come across the epitome of exactly that. It&#8217;s called the &#8220;Fatlace x Stanceworks 512 Project,&#8221; which is basically a car show&#8230; on a race track.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512project1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-79\" title=\"512project1\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512project1-590x277.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512project1-590x277.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512project1.jpg 950w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Just when I thought the whole more-stickers=more-awesome, offset-is-everything, low-or-die, drift-touge-wangan scene couldn&#8217;t stoop any lower, there&#8217;s this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512PJ011.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-81\" title=\"512PJ011\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512PJ011-590x462.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512PJ011-590x462.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512PJ011.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512Pj07.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-80\" title=\"512Pj07\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512Pj07-590x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512Pj07-590x443.jpg 590w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/512Pj07.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>They really did rent out a race track to park on it. I&#8217;m out of things to say, I&#8217;m speechless. The whole &#8220;Stance&#8221; movement and their aggregates (stanceworks\/nation\/country\/city\/town) is too much to comprehend. All I can say is I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m out of the car scene. I feel like I&#8217;ve rid a burden off my back.
