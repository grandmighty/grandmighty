I probably played Half Life and its many Mods the most, which included Counter-Strike (especially hacking in it, don&#8217;t hate). Once Half Life phased out a bit, I remember getting into the Battlefield series with 1942. However, my gaming was on a steady decline through high school, and once I started college, my interest in the subject nearly flat lined. I would pick up a few games to try now and then, but it was hard to really get into them. I found that I would get bored very easily. <\/p>\n<p>Although I may have lost touch with gaming, it was still a pastime so I figured I&#8217;d play homage to it in the form of Battlefield 3. This is literally the first game I&#8217;ve personally purchased (with money) since Battlefield 2 in 2005. We&#8217;ll see how it goes, if this game&#8217;s experience is anything like it was with its predecessor, it will be interesting enough. I <em>really<\/em> hope I don&#8217;t end up dropping this game after an hour like I do with so many others (I paid $50 for a digital copy, when did games get so expensive?!)&#8230; I&#8217;m also curious if my 3 year old refurbished <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2011\/01\/workspace-part-2\/\">Gateway<\/a> will even run it. <\/p>\n<p>Anyway, if anybody out there is reading this and also pre-ordered Battlefield 3, add me on Origin!
