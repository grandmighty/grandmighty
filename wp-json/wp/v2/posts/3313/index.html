I&#8217;m not a gamer and truthfully, my computing needs are relatively simple. I just require that a computer to handle the basics, but handle the basics superbly. My decision on which Mac to get was easy. I originally planned on waiting out for the new Macbook Pro, which hopefully will have a Retina display of sorts, but then I woke up and realized that I have no need for a laptop. A desktop is far more <em>comfortable<\/em> to use. <\/p>\n<p>So I went with the 3.1GHZ 27&#8243; iMac. It was really the allure of the gloriously sized display that drew me in. A couple clicks on Amazon and then it became a waiting game. The computer actually came in last Thursday&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/imac27.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/imac27-620x442.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"imac27\" width=\"620\" height=\"442\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3316\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/imac27-620x442.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/imac27-800x571.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/imac27.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;but right out of the box I got a kernel panic within half an hour of use. Hmm&#8230; I never got the equivalent of a Blue Screen of Death from my Gateway, yet this Apple already threw me one. It wasn&#8217;t a fluke either, throughout my total of only a few hours of use, I encountered a handful of kernel panics. I called Apple Care that Saturday to see what could be done, which is when I also noticed 2 dead pixels on the screen. Very shaky grounds to enter the Mac world, in my opinion. Luckily the Support was quite good, and I was able to exchange the iMac with another one from a local Apple store (even though I purchased from Amazon). <\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m typing this post on iMac #2. Unfortunately I&#8217;m <em>still<\/em> not out of the woods yet because the kernel panics haven&#8217;t gone away. Every time I use this computer, it feels like I&#8217;m racing against a bomb detonation. All of this has surely put a shadow over the whole Mac experience.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, the whole reason why I haven&#8217;t been posting lately is because I didn&#8217;t have a computer. Now that I sort of do, I&#8217;ll see what I can update as there is a lot of overdue content to catch up on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the Gateway out of commission, I decided that the times were ripe to try out a Mac.
