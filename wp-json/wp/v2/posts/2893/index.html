I can&#8217;t fully &#8220;own&#8221; a car without giving it a personal touch. The motivating idea behind this BMW is to finally own a car that I don&#8217;t HAVE to touch, to drive it as is. Unfortunately, my wicked ways must have their resolve. <\/p>\n<p>Fear not, I am thoroughly cognizant of how overly-modded the Miata was&#8230; doing that much work is unnecessary and hellish. Which is why I&#8217;ve limited my modifications with this car primarily to 2 key components: Wheels &#038; Exhaust. Wheels because they are single-handledly the most authoritative change you can do to a car&#8217;s aesthetics. Exhaust because I like my cars to be louder than stock, but not obnoxious. Plus, the 135i is so quiet inside that it feels like I&#8217;m driving a Maglev. Too awkward, gotta hear the engine. <\/p>\n<p>Suspension definitely would have been on the short list, but fortunately, the previous owner already installed H&#038;R Coilovers and Swaybars :-) <\/p>\n<p>Once the deal with the car was (mostly) finalized, I pulled the trigger on on a set of 18&#8243; OZ Ultraleggeras in Black. I bought them from Tirerack and a set of BFGoodrich g-Force T\/A KDW 2 in 235\/40\/18 all-around. No more Rotas and no more &#8220;hellaflush&#8221; fitment and no more slamming for me&#8230; I&#8217;ve graduated into the league of function over form. Going off my <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/index.php\/2011\/02\/tire-fitment-stretch-or-no-stretch\/\">Tire Fitment guide<\/a>, I&#8217;d say these wheels are at a <strong>B<\/strong> stretch. <\/p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, I chose to run a square set-up even though the car comes stock staggered and with 245 rears. 1series have a tendency to understeer stock, and running the same size tires all around will help balance it out. I&#8217;m sacrificing 10mm in width for the rears but am gaining 20mm in the fronts over stock. I chose the Ultraleggera&#8217;s primarily because of their low weight, with each wheel tipping the scales at around 18.4lbs. Compare this to the stockers, which are in the neighborhood of 25lbs&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>Mounted with tires, each wheel weighs 44lbs: <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/ultraleggeraweight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/ultraleggeraweight-600x603.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"ultraleggeraweight\" width=\"600\" height=\"603\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2899\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/ultraleggeraweight-600x603.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/ultraleggeraweight-290x290.jpg 290w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/ultraleggeraweight-900x905.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/ultraleggeraweight.jpg 994w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>After owning the car for a mere one day, I enlisted the help of a buddy to roll the rear fenders. The lips on the front fenders are like a &#8220;V&#8221;, but the rears are more of an &#8220;L&#8221;. We attempted to roll the rears, but ultimately pulled the plug on that idea. The lips are too thick, and I didn&#8217;t want to jeopardize the body at all. There was too much risk of the fender pulling out if a full roll was attempted. So instead, we set about removing the 10mm H&#038;R spacers the car came with. The spacers were fused to the rear hubs due to rust&#8230; heatgun + a lot of hammering with a screwdriver did the trick. <\/p>\n<p>Today, my agenda was to grind out and dial the car&#8217;s ride height with the new wheels. I&#8217;m not a big fan of playing with coilovers in this respect, because it&#8217;s rather tedious work. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/garagework.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/garagework-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"garagework\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2895\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/garagework-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/garagework-900x675.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/garagework.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Eventually I was able to sit the car at a satisfactory height: 1 finger gap.
