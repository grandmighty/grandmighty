As an up-and-coming amateur mechanic, I learned by doing and trial &amp; error. I was not blessed with state of the art equipment nor facilities. I remember making use of whatever I could from random tools lying around the house and a cheap Husky socket set. When I was tinkering with my first car, I lived in a townhouse and then later moved into an archaic rented house with a cramped garage. Less than ideal, but we all have to start somewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Slowly, as I began to delve deeper and deeper into the car world, I amassed my collection of tools. I was eventually able to obtain a level of quality and cohesion in my garage set up to allow for comfortable workflow. A far cry from my humble beginnings, but nothing impressive or out of the ordinary.<\/p>\n<p>Which is why I decided to step it up a notch this time around. Prior to the moving date, I filtered through my inventory of tools and threw away the junk while adding in some upgrades. With the star of the new additions being the pair of Snap-on Dual80 ratchets. The longer one with the comfort handle is a locking flex-head type. Both ratchets are 3\/8&#8243; drive, which I feel is the most useful size; it&#8217;s strong enough to handle high torque and small enough to be versatile. You shouldn&#8217;t need 1\/2&#8243; until you&#8217;re in the 20mm+ range, in my opinion. I can&#8217;t wait to put them to work, the Dual80 mechanism offers an incredible degree of ratchet arc&#8230; it makes standard ratchets seem sloppy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/snaponratchet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3697\" title=\"snaponratchet\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/snaponratchet-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/snaponratchet-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/snaponratchet-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/snaponratchet.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Although the generic, <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/2011\/02\/how-to-service-your-craftsman-ratchet\/\">overhauled<\/a> Craftsman ratchet (left) has been my bread-and-butter tool for a few years, it will now serve as my backup.

During the same time, I assembled my new Craftsman Professional 5ft workbench. Along with the pegboard attachment, the workbench is the centerpiece of the garage.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/garage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3699\" title=\"garage\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/garage-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/garage-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/garage-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/garage.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I love it, all my frequently used tools are easily accessible and having a tabletop is a great improvement. Before, whenever I needed to work on a smaller part, I usually did it on the concrete floor.

I went with a more conservative approach here and picked up an el-cheapo Walmart special. It may be plastic, but functions more than adequately to hold all my cleaners and other liquids.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/storagecabinet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3701\" title=\"storagecabinet\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/storagecabinet-620x826.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/storagecabinet-620x826.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/storagecabinet-800x1066.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/storagecabinet.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I know that my garage may be relatively modest and can&#8217;t compare to high-dollar setups with custom cabinetry and so forth, but what I have now is a world apart from what I&#8217;ve been used to. It is organized to my liking and is well stocked with the necessary essentials; these are most crucial to promote workflow. I shudder at images of dirty garages with tools strewn everywhere and parts stored haphazardly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/3cargarage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3703\" title=\"3cargarage\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/3cargarage-620x465.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/3cargarage-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/3cargarage-800x600.jpg 800w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/3cargarage.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In true fanboy fashion, I have the Mazda banner hanging high.
