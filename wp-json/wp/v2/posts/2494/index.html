In the morning, I prepped and repainted the mid fairings&#8230; for the 5th time. The first 3 times, I used a different type of paint which was hard to lay a smooth finish, and I was never happy with it. For the fourth time, I actually had the local paint shop give it a try. Unfortunately, it came out to be too glossy. So I scuffed it all down and tried once again myself. I think it&#8217;s finally good enough, either that or I&#8217;m just too fed up to care anymore. <\/p>\n<p>Here were the mid fairings before, I didn&#8217;t like the random silver.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/cbrmidfairings.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/cbrmidfairings-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"cbrmidfairings\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2495\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/cbrmidfairings-600x450.jpg 600w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/cbrmidfairings-900x675.jpg 900w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/cbrmidfairings.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So I went with a flat black to keep the theme dark.
