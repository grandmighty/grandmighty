The route included going out to Coyote Hills via Alvarado Niles (before I used to always take Paseo Padre, but I now prefer this), going out to the boat, coming back and doing 2 loops around the back side of the park. The tailwind coming back from the boat felt great, and going around the back of the mountain shielded the wind as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/coyotehillstrail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-642\" title=\"coyotehillstrail\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/coyotehillstrail-540x720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/coyotehillstrail-540x720.jpg 540w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/coyotehillstrail.jpg 675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Good ride with a decent pace.
