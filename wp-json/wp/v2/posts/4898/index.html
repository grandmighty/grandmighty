Since I had to remove the majority of the trim whilst working on the dash, I decided to go one step further and strip down each of the individual trim pieces. I felt that the black plastics were getting bland and decided to spice things up by having them repainted. <\/p>\n<p>Initially, the goal was to administer a subtle change: I wanted to replicate the Spirit-R trim panels, which were a charcoal grey color. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2002_Mazda_RX7SpiritR3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2002_Mazda_RX7SpiritR3-777x582.jpg\" alt=\"2002_Mazda_RX7SpiritR3\" width=\"777\" height=\"582\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4899\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2002_Mazda_RX7SpiritR3-777x582.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2002_Mazda_RX7SpiritR3-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2002_Mazda_RX7SpiritR3.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>To my knowledge, the Spirit-Rs feature a &#8220;soft feeling&#8221; paint on their trim pieces. This lead me to discover the Alsa line of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alsacorp.com\/products\/softtouch\/softtouch.htm\">SoftTouch<\/a> paint, which seemed perfect for this application. Repainting a few plastic pieces appeared to be a trivial task at first glance, but by the series of events to follow, this was one of the most grueling and lengthy exercises I&#8217;ve encountered. To provide perception, I first dropped off the pieces to a local body shop (who performed a small job on my old <a href=\"http:\/\/7tuned.com\/category\/projects\/miata\/\">Miata<\/a> prior) over 3 months ago&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I shared pictures of the Spirit R interior and explained my desired color, a matte, OEM-like charcoal grey. A kit of the Alsa SoftTouch was then ordered. In the process of shooting, the SoftTouch paint wasn&#8217;t mixed properly and a few of the pieces would not dry properly. This meant a special paint remover, one that works with plastics, had to be ordered to strip everything down again for another reshoot. Almost 4 weeks later, they were finally ready for pick up.<\/p>\n<p>Immediately upon my arrival to the body shop, I saw that the grey color was too light of a shade. I ended up paying for the job twice in order to redo them, and I also had to buy another kit of the SoftTouch paint (over $200 for just materials) because the first kit was expended. Fast forward to another 3 weeks of waiting for the SoftTouch to arrive, stripping the paint off again, and reshooting&#8230; the color ends up being too dark this time. At this point, I just took all the panels back home so I could have time and space to think about the next move.<\/p>\n<p>I knew I still wasn&#8217;t happy with the results, even though so much time had been lost. I looked into other options, wrapping the pieces in vinyl came up as an idea. In the end, I opted for another repaint &#8211; with the exception of ditching the Alsa paint. I was going to stick to normal paint in a smooth, glossy, 2-stage finish. I also took the pieces to a different body shop this time around. <\/p>\n<p>For the sake of brevity, I&#8217;ll keep this next section brief. From having the paint react poorly with the Alsa undercoat to me being unhappy with bumps and non-smooth areas, these pieces were reshot 4-5 times each at body shop #2. Although I required the work to be expedited, given the circumstances, this took another 3 weeks to complete.<\/p>\n<p>Now I finally have the pieces back in my possession and to my satisfaction. With the exception of the gauge cluster surround &#8211; I still discovered minor blemishes in its finish and they are repainting it once more. Ultimately, the color I chose to go with was a nice, metallic grey. Porsche &#8220;Meteor Grey&#8221;, to be exact. I think it looks stunning and the contrast it provides against the black interior helps to elevate the plastics&#8217; perceived quality. <\/p>\n<p>Pictured below are the shifter surround and climate control panel, all reassembled:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpaint.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpaint-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"interiorpaint\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5050\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpaint-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpaint-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/interiorpaint.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>And the door panels reinstalled:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/driverdoor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/driverdoor-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"driverdoor\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5048\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/driverdoor-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/driverdoor-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/driverdoor.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/gunmetal.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/gunmetal-777x518.jpg\" alt=\"gunmetal\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5049\" srcset=\"http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/gunmetal-777x518.jpg 777w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/gunmetal-960x640.jpg 960w, http:\/\/grandmighty.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/gunmetal.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Fingers crossed that once I am able to get the gauge surround back, I can finally button up the interior and just start driving.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Dash Project was essentially a segue into a comprehensive interior overhaul.
