										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of NEWS in this one! Please give it a thorough read, as this will likely be my final post on Grand Mighty.</p>
<p>For nearly an entire decade, I have maintained and written articles for Grand Mighty. I wrote on a couple of similar websites prior, even, but those have since been dissolved and the material is long forgotten. While this was all a great exercise in my commitment to a task, the time has now come to head towards a new horizon. </p>
<p>Although I still enjoy doing it and probably always will, writing on a website or blog is losing its luster and falling behind with the times. The reward feedback from it is relatively low. Aside from the comments that are left by readers, there is little interactivity and the reach is certainly lower. If I am going to invest the effort to document my projects, I want to do so on a medium that will provide the greatest yield and prolificness. </p>
<p>So to keep up with the times, I am migrating to YouTube! I just picked up all of my camera gear and filmed my first &#8220;episode&#8221; today. It is certainly a different experience than just sitting down and typing out words, but hopefully you all will find it interesting. </p>

<p>I will be posting on a channel called &#8220;Corner Balanced&#8221;, which is a collaboration project with my buddy Tommy. </p>
<p>Here is the link: <a href="http://youtube.com/c/cornerbalanced">http://youtube.com/c/cornerbalanced</a></p>
<p>The name might sound familiar, because it comes from the forum/community startup that <a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2016/06/cornerbalanced-com/">I tried around this time last year</a>, which eventually ran a brief course and was deleted. </p>
<p>HOWEVER &#8211; the Corner Balanced forum was resurrected and redeveloped through a different set of lenses a couple months ago, and has been kicking ever since. I have been spending much of my time on there as of late. Check it out and join if you can, it will be the best way to contact me going forward. I want to utilize it as a platform to fill in details pertaining to the videos and engage in related discussions.</p>
<p><a href="http://cornerbalanced.com/">http://cornerbalanced.com/</a> </p>
<p>I intend for the forum to go hand-in-hand with the YouTube channel. With the RX-7 sold&#8230; I have speared off into a new direction. I will try to explain the motives and reasonings behind my choices in the upcoming videos. But to cut to the chase, I will be keeping busy with a couple new projects, namely this AE86 GTS. </p>

<p>I thank you all for reading Grand Mighty over all these years, it really means a lot. I am scheming up plans to convert Grand Mighty into something else&#8230; so keep an eye out in the future. If you&#8217;d like to stay in tune with all of my continued shenanigans, I will see you on the Corner Balanced YouTube channel and the forums. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For 5 years, I held firm to the notion that I would keep this RX-7 and, thus, I built it with the freedom that comes with having no expiration. My goals reached ever higher on a continuous basis. I kept firm to an unwavering vision of building the ultimate street RX-7. That kind of persistence made me iterate and redo things until I got it just right. After all, this was going to be my personal, long-term car&#8230; and there could be no compromise. </p>
<p>From the day I purchased it, I followed a strict standard with close adherence to details. I specifically chose one of the rarest and most sought after RX-7s to serve as an ideal foundation: A USDM, &#8217;94, Brilliant Black, Low Miles, Low Owner Count, R2 package. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7679" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120-1250x938.jpg 1250w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4120.jpg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>My mod list, however extensive, only tells half the story. If you kept up with this website or read through the pages, you know that this was a long journey of immense effort. One that could not be replicated again &#8211; if I were to start from scratch today. </p>
<p>The hindsight of thinking that I could keep a car forever parallels my misunderstanding of others who sell their sports cars to start families. I was always perplexed at why people had to sacrifice their pride and joy. Why couldn&#8217;t fun and responsibilities coexist? Well, it&#8217;s not that easy, in actuality. There is also a cruel irony to all of this. When I had more time in the past, I spent it building this car. Now that it is done, I have no time and am unable to enjoy it. Adulting is hard and catches up with everyone, and I&#8217;m not getting any younger. </p>
<p>That is why I have made the conscious decision to list the car for sale. If I had more means and space, then I really could have kept it forever. But due to the magnitude of expenditure in this project, it is simply beyond the scope of allowing it to sit indefinitely. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-777x339.png" alt="" width="777" height="339" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7680" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-777x339.png 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-768x335.png 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-960x418.png 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-200x87.png 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-1250x545.png 1250w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-9.29.45-AM-400x174.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>With that said, I am selling the car at an extreme discount with respect to what has been poured in. This is a great opportunity to get into the car with high value. </p>
<p>If you are interested, please contact me. It would be amazing if it could land in the hands of a reader and someone who has been there every step of the way with me. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After having the car sit in the garage for the better half of a year, I was sick of seeing it in a constantly dusty state. I was also sick of having to detail and wax a black car, which is laborious and quite the uphill battle. Instead of pulling out the random orbiter and polishing the car myself, I decided it was time to bring in professional help. </p>
<p>This is where Kevin of <a href="https://www.autowerksdetailing.com/">Auto Werks Detailing</a> comes in. Not only was he flexible with the scheduling &#8211; I dropped off the car before a flight and then picked it up after my return &#8211; but he does great work. I had him do a full paint correction and detail on the car, and then top it off with an Opti-Coat ceramic coating. The idea of the ceramic coating is that it provides a long-term, wax-like barrier above your paint. This means future mars or swirls will be less prone, and if they do occur, they will be on the coating not the clear coat. The biggest advantage ceramic coating provides is the low maintenance, which is crucial for a black car. </p>
<p>I feel like when your detailing procedure has many steps, you introduce more possibilities for errors. Even when you&#8217;re waxing or trying to protect the paint, minor deviances in technique is enough to actually cause harm rather than good. This is why I never liked to repeatedly add on wax. Now with the ceramic coating, I shouldn&#8217;t have to. I can literally just hose down the car from time to time, and pat it dry. The hydrophobic properties of the coating makes washing easy and the car can keep a detailed look with minimal effort. </p>
<p>I dropped the car off to him at the warehouse he works out of, which had a cool collection of cars inside. </p>

<p>On my way back home from my return flight, I took an Uber and met up with Kevin again at the warehouse. This was at around 11PM, which was super convenient and accommodating. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect, but when I first saw the car under the lights, I was stunned. The surface literally looked like glass. I was amazed at the results and regretful of not having done it sooner. The paintwork is extremely high end, but I do a poor job of keeping it at its potential by leaving the car in an unending state of dust. </p>

<p>Now, I stand a good chance of changing that pattern. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last piece to trickle in from oCarbon was the passenger trim around the grip handle on the door card. A number of compound curves in this area made it particularly difficult to wrap over and get right. All in all, the entire process to get all of my interior pieces finished in carbon fiber took 5 months. The wait was long, but that&#8217;s how these custom things go.</p>

<p>To pair up with the Alcantara wrapped door card, I also asked ESH Upholstering to redo the SakeBomb aluminum grip handle in Alcantara. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grips.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grips-777x1036.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="1036" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7653" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grips-777x1036.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grips-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grips-150x200.jpg 150w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grips-400x533.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grips.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>To install the new grip handle, the mounting hole at the base of the handle needed to be drilled out slightly and fastened with a machine screw into tapped threads on the grip. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newhardware.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newhardware-777x1036.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="1036" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7657" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newhardware-777x1036.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newhardware-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newhardware-150x200.jpg 150w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newhardware-400x533.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newhardware.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>Here it is joined back together with the trim piece. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaragrip.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaragrip-777x1036.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="1036" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7649" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaragrip-777x1036.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaragrip-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaragrip-150x200.jpg 150w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaragrip-400x533.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaragrip.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>Next, it was time to mate everything back to the door card&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7648" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alcantaradoorcard.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;and then install the door card back to the car. To be comprehensive, I replaced all of the push-on fasteners with new OEM ones. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7655" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mazdafasteners.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>I taped up the sensitive carbon areas around the door cup to prevent scratching it when installing the door cup, which, like the driver side, is a cast aluminum reproduction.</p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7654" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/installation.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>I particularly like these door cups because they measurably increase the feel of sturdiness when pulling on the doors to open or close them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Better late than never &#8211; I am going to try and knock out a few remaining updates that I have been behind on. There is a reason to the recent inactivity, which I will address later. </p>
<p>I am at a point now where I am satisfied with the RX-7. Bugs that irked me have been corrected. Aesthetics that didn&#8217;t live up to the desired results have been redone. I took a step back and for the first time ever, took a mindful view of my journey with this car. I can admit to having done things to excessive levels. The point of diminishing returns was surpassed long ago. I am finally ceasing operations and the tail lights being outlined in this post will be the last major addition. </p>
<p>Although the OEM &#8217;99 tail lights were befitting, I decided to take an extra step and try out the new Version 4 LED tail lights by Car Shop GLOW. The goal has always been to follow an understated, OEM+ path, but with the recent additions like the RE-Amemiya rear diffuser, my car is forking off towards the more modified direction. That&#8217;s why I felt like the changeup to LED tail lights would be worthwhile as a final accent. Unlike the more prolific Version 1s which had dotted LEDs throughout, these newer lights feature a diffused section of LEDs. I think these new lights have a more professional look.  </p>
<p>The hardest part of acquiring and installing these tail lights was picking them up from my local USPS office. I ended up having to go twice, early in the morning, before retrieving the package. They left a notice on my door, but the first time I went to the office with it, the driver never unloaded and carried it around for another day. </p>

<p>Eventually it was in my possession and it was time to open things up. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7634" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/boxpackage.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>I ordered all 3 pieces, including the third brake light section with LEDs. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7636" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshopglowlights.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a closer look at one of the tails. You can see the diffused strip.</p>

<p>OEM &#8217;99 versus CSG LED.</p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7641" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oldvsnew.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>Backside with a branding placard. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshowglow.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshowglow-777x1036.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="1036" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7637" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshowglow-777x1036.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshowglow-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshowglow-150x200.jpg 150w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshowglow-400x533.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carshowglow.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>Removing the tails from the car was a straightforward job.</p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7644" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved-768x576.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved-960x720.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tailsremoved.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>Since the buckets behind the lights were dusty and dirty, I of course had to give everything a wipe down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey! Long time no see. I have been swamped lately and just don&#8217;t have the capacity to sit and update this website. Hopefully, I will fall back into a more predictable rhythm soon and I can announce some news. Until then, I wanted to take the opportunity to make current my RX-7&#8217;s mod list.</p>
<p>The car has been great. I spend most of my time driving it and taking it to the canyons. Like last weekend, with friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While in the middle of my drive last weekend, I discovered that my passenger door lock had annoyingly committed suicide out of the blue. I was able to lock it with my key just fine, however, when I went to go unlock it half an hour later, the key oddly wouldn&#8217;t insert anymore. The key hole&#8217;s plastic cover had shattered into pieces and lodged itself into the tumblers. An easy option would have been to remove the lock cylinder and try to pick out all of the plastic pieces on a bench, but I liked the function of the plastic cover protecting the internals from the environment, so the only resort was to buy a complete replacement. </p>
<p>I wanted to get the fix done quickly, as in by this weekend. With only 5 business days to work with, I promptly started the process and made arrangements with my usual go-tos. I contacted Ray Crowe and ordered a new Mazda lock cylinder with expedited shipping. This would get me the part by Friday. I was then able to pick up the package after work and made a trip over to the same locksmith that helped me rekey the <a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2016/10/silvia-trunk-lock/">Silvia trunk</a>. Like before, he was able to reconfigure the tumblers to fit my existing keys. </p>

<p>Thankfully, replacing the lock cylinder is an easy affair and can be done with minimal disassembly. Soon enough, the install was complete and the fix checked off the list. </p>
<p>I like to stay as productive as possible because I value time preciously. I find that I can be uneasy or feel downright miserable when I am not doing something worthwhile. In the limited free time that I have, I prefer spending it on activities that are engaging. This is why I constantly seek to learn and increase my skills. Learning how to weld has been on my to-do list for ages, and I finally made it happen this weekend. I reached out to a local fabricator who had a Mig setup and brought Albert along for the party. </p>
<p>This was the first time I played with a Mig welder, but it is incredibly straightforward and I can see how its peak can be reached relatively quickly with practice. It is literally something you can pick up and run with. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/migpractice.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/migpractice-777x1036.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="1036" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7602" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/migpractice-777x1036.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/migpractice-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/migpractice-150x200.jpg 150w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/migpractice-400x533.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/migpractice.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>We spent a few hours mostly cutting up a steel pipe and welding it back, repeatedly. </p>
<p><a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding-777x583.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="583" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7605" srcset="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding-777x583.jpg 777w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding-768x577.jpg 768w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding-960x721.jpg 960w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding-200x150.jpg 200w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding-400x300.jpg 400w, https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/welding.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></a></p>
<p>Mig welding was good to try out and start with, but what I really want to learn is Tig, which has a far higher learning curve. Will need to add that onto the ever expanding agenda. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went on an encompassing tour of the Bay Area with Mike last Saturday, with the drive culminating in a last minute destination to Alice&#8217;s in Woodside. By the time we left and reached arrived back to my neighborhood, the sun was starting to set&#8230; which meant that the Golden Hour was upon us and I didn&#8217;t want to let such an optimal setting of light go to waste. I quickly grabbed and dusted off my trusty Canon 5D Classic and took these shots. This was the first time I used a real camera in over a year. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I received my gauge fascia piece with oCarbon&#8217;s first completed batch <a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2017/01/ocarbon-part-iii/">back in January</a>, I couldn&#8217;t actually install it. The fascia needed to be connected together with the hood piece, and then the entire cluster could be mounted into the car. Waiting for the completion of the hood was tantalizing and elicited feelings of helplessness at times. </p>
<p>At long last, and after much prodding, oCarbon came through with the work and I had a well overlaid carbon fiber hood in my hands. Unfortunately, I still couldn&#8217;t fully install the whole assembly, because the 3 mounting clips on the underside of the hood were removed and forgotten. That delayed the effort yet another week until the clips were eventually tracked down. </p>
<p>After having to see the gauge fascia sitting lonesomely on top of my pool table for months, I anxiously mated it back with the hood. </p>

<p>The moment of truth&#8230; I then maneuvered the entire cluster carefully into the car, plugged everything in, and was granted this belated yet relieving sight. The momentary buttons, S2000 start button, and AiM Dash all came to life and operated without issue.</p>

<p>There is no doubt you have to wait when it comes to dealing with oCarbon&#8230; but you do at least get what you paid for, at some point. I just wish their extremely overdue turnaround times did not have to overshadow the quality of work, because I have no complaints about the delivered product. </p>

<p>Many years of effort have led me to this interior. I lost count of which iteration this is, but it is surely the closest realization to my ideal specifications. </p>

<p>A while ago, I sold my custom ordered <a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2016/05/nardi-gara-sport-in-custom-blackblack-suede/">Nardi Gara Sport</a> and picked up a new MOMO Mod 88. I just felt like it was time for a new look and that the MOMO would suit the overall theme of the new interior better. It is also D-shaped and all black suede. I was finally able to run my <a href="https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2016/05/on-the-shelf/">red Mazdaspeed horn button</a>, that I purchased a year ago, below the optional MOMO Competition horn ring. </p>

<p>Months of hard work and patience have now brought me one step away from the finish line. The passenger side door card is all that is left. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be long. </p>
