					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s too bad you&#039;ve been so soured on the whole modified car thing, but I certainly know where you&#039;re coming from, having wasted untold tens of thousands of dollars on different project cars that never came near the intended fruition. In fact, I have a non-running money-pit project car in my garage right now. Not only has dinking with cars caused me tremendous unnecessary stress, financial drain, and frustration, but also has negatively affected my wife of many patient and forgiving years. 

Good luck with staying away from tuner cars and being satisfied driving a &quot;normal&quot; car. Having the sportbike should make it a lot easier, though.]]></description>
