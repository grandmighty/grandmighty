					<description><![CDATA[I came across this post by way of research into towing motorcycles via trailer hitches, particularly U-Haul trailer hitches and trailers.  Similar to you and your track bike, I have a dirt bike with no local places to ride.  So I&#039;m looking into ways of towing.  I have a Hyundai Tucson and I&#039;m hoping it will be easier to tow than a Prius.  I also have a street bike and considering that towing might be more beneficial for longer trips, as well.  So your information here has been very helpful. Never been track riding before but surprised to read that Thunderhill is bumpy.  But thanks for posting!  And I hope you&#039;ve been able to get out and enjoy the open road more.  

Ride safe!
