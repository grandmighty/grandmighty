					<description><![CDATA[Nice post bro. This reminds me of me and my Studio Maintenance class for school. Currently trying to learn how to prep XLR, instrument, TRS (tip-ring-sleeve) cables. I gotta get myself that wire stripping tool like yours. I had TOO many cases of making an attempt to strip the wire and ending up cutting off a wire in the process. Of course, I&#039;d have to cut the wire short again and redo it since not all the wires are of the same length allowing the proper current flow through them. I gotta practice soldering too cuz putting wires into a pot with solder for the connectors is quite challenging. =P]]></description>
