					<description><![CDATA[Ah, the Caspian Sea Monster. I didn&#039;t know about CCCP&#039;s wacky ekranoplans until I played Metal Gear Solid 3 (See, video games can be educational, mom! It&#039;s just a shame it&#039;s taken well over 30 years to have a counterpoint in that argument.)

The Lun-class had anti-ship missiles, not torpedoes, but when your ship is sitting at the bottom of a substantial body of water, the end result is the same. It&#039;s not a proper plane, but a ground effect vehicle that skims over water at an altitude of only a few meters. The end result is they can be huge compared to a fixed wing aircraft, carry a substantial quantity of men and equipment (1000 tons!).

Stumbled across the blog and really enjoying it. 

Oh those Russians...]]></description>
