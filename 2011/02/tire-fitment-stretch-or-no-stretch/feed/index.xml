					<description><![CDATA[In terms of performance, the rim width should be equal to the TREAD width for optimum tire performance. As far as technical correctness, any tire will have a rim width range that is acceptable and part of the spec. You should be able to find it on a tire&#039;s manufacturer&#039;s site, or a place like tire rack.

As far as the examples show, A is my limit for bulge. B and C are perfect. D is my limit and likely has the rim as wide as the SECTION width, there. and E, F and G look stupid. Something like negative A or beyond would also look stupid.

Seriously, if you can&#039;t get by on D, you need to widebody/flare it some more or just deal with the skinnier wheels and tires. Same goes for A, if you want a wider tire after A, you need to get wider wheels. Otherwise, you&#039;re just screwing yourself and looking ignorant at the same time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally love the &quot;slight stretch&quot; look.. my e30 has about the same stretch as D, and its the perfect look to me.  G is just ridiculous, and even F is too much unless u have the right car.. E is the most stretch i like.

mostly, my tire fitment preference greatly depends on the car, some cars need meaty, some need stretch.. there is no &quot;universal&quot; fitment.]]></description>
