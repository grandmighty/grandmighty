					<description><![CDATA[Hey there, I just visited my ENT doctor and as he cleaned out my left ear he tells me I have a CG. He is having me do a treatment called BOV. Some sort of purple fluid and then a powder. He plans to do this every 2 weeks to avoid surgery. I&#039;m not finding any information on this method. He didn&#039;t tell me much about it so I&#039;m feeling nervous and he didn&#039;t do an MRI or CT. 
I&#039;d appreciate any information on this method or as to why he isn&#039;t doing g any imagining.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Eric
I have been diagnosed with a CG left Petrous Apex. It’s 13mm and my symptoms are mainly constant dizziness, facial swelling and blurred vision. I am from the Caribbean and may have to travel to the US for treatment as my ENT says he has never seen a case like this before. It’s now 2018...any recommendations for a good doctor in the US? 
Thanks 
Brenda]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eric hello

As part of the overall procedure &#038; surgery at any stage have the docs thought to check the nature of the cyst ? If this is indeed benign ? or this kind of CG cyst is only benign? 

thanks a lot !]]></description>

Scott,

My 17 old son was just diagnosed with CG and we too live in Utah. I am curious to know who your doctor was. 

Have you had surgery? If so, what surgical approach did they take? Has it been successful?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eric,

Thank you for an informative blog.

I was diagnosed with a GC last week here in Utah, after an initial MRI and subsequent head CT, Radiologist confirmed 2cm GC next to right inner ear, wearing away bone.

My initial symptom was vertigo, followed by facial weakness on right side (watering eye, drooping eyebrow, and weakness in lips).

Meeting with Neurosurgeon on Monday to discuss potential treatment(s) and reoccurrence issues.

While I have a number of questions ready, was there a specific question(s) that you wished you asked before your initial procedure?]]></description>

Hi Sid, l was wondering how your CG diagnosis has gone. I live in the UK and my 16 year old daughter was diagnosed with CG on the left petrous apex and am still waiting for the hospital to confirm if is really a CG or anything else. Which hospital where you referred to. Which hospital did the first diagnosis? My daughter&#039;s MRI scan results were out about a month ago, but the doc  is still waiting for a second report to confirm the findings]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi I have just be told today following an MR and CT scan that I have CG of the temporal bone.  Im in the UK and this is considered a very rare condition so being refered to a specialist unit at another hospital.  I have already been warned that it is 99% certain it will require a mastoidectomy.

Watch this space I guess just waiting for my next appointment]]></description>

After the surgery described in this post, I had the fluid come back within a month. I ended up undergoing a second surgery that was a full mastoidectomy from the back of the ear. I feel that this is the only way to gain the necessary access to properly remove the CG. 

Were your 2 surgeries both through the ear drum/tympanoplasties? If so, I would recommend pursuing a mastoidectomy and you should have more successful results. 

Best of luck, I know the struggle you are facing and it is difficult to deal with... but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.]]></description>
