Hi Ethel, sorry to hear he&#039;s going through this. Could you tell me a little more about his symptoms? Did he always have hearing loss in that one ear, started getting pulsatile tinnitus, etc.? Feel free to email me directly: eric@grandmighty.com 

What surgery did he end up going with? The one I described here where the ear drum was lifted was my first attempt at curing the cholesterol granuloma. 

Unfortunately, it only took a few months for it to come back. I ended up going through with a mastoidectomy as that&#039;s the only way to gain full access to the middle ear and mastoid where the CG is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Eric! I just want to know how your cholesterol granuloma has been post-surgery. Has it recurred or has it been suppressed? My boyfriend is going through the same thing. His is in his middle ear and hasn&#039;t penetrated the petrous apex. He went for an operation in June &#039;13 and now it&#039;s already November &#039;13 and it hasn&#039;t resolved. It&#039;s just getting worse. The doctor is so unsure and he said that the only other option is another operation to remove the temporal bones to get behind the middle ear to see if that&#039;s the cause. It&#039;s just so worrying and I just want to know if yours is better and what type of operation you had and how your hearing is right now. Would be really grateful if you could elaborate on your post-op journey. Thanks!]]></description>

Hi Doug, from what I know, CG in the mastoid region and CG in the petrous apex have different procedures and implications. Mine was in the mastoid so I had a tympanomastoidectomy to get it removed. I would recommend looking into the Endonasal approach for your petrous apex CG. 

Best of luck to you, try not to let it bother you. If you have to take action, find comfort in knowing that there are solutions available. You could look around at different doctors and clinics to find the best surgery option.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The wonders of Google, my friend. Through this whole process and my researching, I inadvertently learned a lot about the ear, which is a plus.  

A Cholesterol Granuloma was indeed the official diagnosis. The minimally invasive surgery you speak of (Endoscopic Endonasal Approach) is primarily limited to if the granuloma was present at the petrous apex, not the middle ear like I have. Although having it in the middle ear is still much better than if it formed at the petrous apex. 

The surgeon used a transcanal method and lifted up my ear drum :-)]]></description>
