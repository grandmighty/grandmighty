					<description><![CDATA[Nice come up with those Oakleys. I too have acquired some Oakleys, a pair of Frogskins. Turned them into eyeglasses though. :) I lost my shades at the Irish pub out in Marina Del Rey though, no more Aviators for me. :( But since it&#039;s already been a year with my insurance, I&#039;m allowed to get a pair of frames and lenses. I plan on getting some Wayfarers like you, just to sort of &quot;match&quot; the Frogskins. It was originally going to be vice versa, but decided the other way. Yeh!]]></description>
