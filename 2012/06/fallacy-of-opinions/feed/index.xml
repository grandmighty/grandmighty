					<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;m just blog &quot;challenged&quot; to post something in detail. I feel like sometimes if I post in minute detail, It&#039;d be too much or something. I don&#039;t know. lol I just wished I had the language structure/diction that you have when blogging. Mine&#039;s more a little bit casual and what not. I definitely find your blog more intriguing because the way you post. Freakin&#039; genius.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope I don&#039;t fall under that category of lacking content in a blog post. I know I do take the &quot;easy&quot; road sometimes an just &quot;blog&quot; chords to a song, but I use those song posts as a reference at least. I guess I just need to take the time to blog some thorough thoughts within a post. Anywho, thanks for allowing me to be part of Grand Mighty. I hope what I blog is enough to be even a &quot;blog post&quot;.]]></description>
