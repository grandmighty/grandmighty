					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] After calling around, I was given a referral to a fabricator and mechanic named Marcus Fry, who branched off and started his own shop a year ago. After my initial conversation with him, I felt like he was a good match to hand off the project to and met my criteria: small, owner operated shop and was willing to dedicate the lift exclusively to my car until the swap was complete. I didn&#8217;t like the idea of having my car moved inside and outside while work was done simultaneously on other clients. Marcus was very accommodating and had all the right skills &#8211; there are several fabrication work I will need which he can do. I scheduled in the date with him to start the project and he came by to my house on July 6th to transport the LS3/TR6060. It&#8217;s interesting that almost exactly 2 years ago was when I first received the car. [&#8230;]]]></description>
