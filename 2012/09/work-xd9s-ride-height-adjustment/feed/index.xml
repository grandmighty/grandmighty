					<description><![CDATA[Hi Eric,

Very nice fitment, done proper I say.

Couple questions; how high is the car from the ground at the cars lowest point (excluding the exhaust)

What height are your adjustable shocks set to?

Do any of the tires rub on any part of the car? so like.... front tyres when fully locked to one side....they dont rub on the inside of the fender by the window washer container/radiator over flow bottle or the likes?

And with the rear....they don&#039;t rub on the top of the fender or anything?

Loving the look of your car and want similar fitment just don&#039;t want any hassles with rubbing of any kind.]]></description>

Sorry to hear about your accident, but at least you got something good out of it. A full repaint is no small thing, that&#039;s for sure. 

Do you know if there&#039;s a car event or anything coming up?]]></description>

Things wih the supra are going great. I was on my way to the bodyshop to get my new shine parts put on when I got T-boned. While I was waiting for the repair work to be done, my wife decided to surprise me with a full repaint  and shaving my rear wiper, antenna, spoiler holes etc. as a wedding gift. I have yet to change things since, but that&#039;s because I need a job and we are recovering from moving and our wedding. I would be so down to meet up some time to check out your ride and talk cars.]]></description>

Thanks Brian! You came back in good timing as this project is just apexing from months of prior work. 

How has your Supra been? I am eager to see where the &quot;HWY DMN&quot; is today ;-) Maybe I can catch you in person one of these days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have not been to your site in a very long long time. This is the first time back and I am pleasantly surprised that you got back into an FD. Loving the progress that I have seen you make on the car already.  Ken also finally has pictures of my red supra with Shine products on it so he can use them. I&#039;ll be keepin my eyes on this car as i expect good things from it. You seem to always do things the right way and I admire that in your builds.]]></description>
