					<description><![CDATA[Been following your page for quite a a while and very impressed with all of the work. I have a fd with a single turbo conversion and lately I&#039;ve been working a lot and wonder how you have free time to work on yours haha. When you are ready to sell this one, I call dibs :)]]></description>

Never drove a S2000!
