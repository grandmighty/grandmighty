					<description><![CDATA[Honestly this was the first build I have ever fell in love with (even though it isn&#039;t a 240). I don&#039;t think any one I know can build a car with as much attention to detail as you dude. This is the benchmark for my build :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe this stems from a bit of OCD, but I disliked having vestigial buttons around that served no function. Since my car no longer has A/C, only the fan, I wanted all of the A/C stuff gone. The buttons/lights on the shifter console were totally useless from the factory, anyway. 

The MXG provides all the simplifying and consolidation that I was looking for, without having gauges strewn everywhere. And, it&#039;s badass... it&#039;s a full color TFT LED display. I&#039;ll expand on this bit later :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude this is pretty interesting. What motivated you to shift the interiors look and fill? Also what was your thoughts about going with the MXG?]]></description>
