Glad you checked back in Wendell. And yep, I abandoned the idea of forums permanently and decided to bring back the blog and overhaul it at the same time. 

I actually am going to be selling my glossy interior pieces. If you&#039;re interested, shoot me an email through here or send me a PM on RX7Club :)]]></description>
