					<description><![CDATA[I have the Defined V-Mount on my single turbo FD, I can attest to how great of a performer it is. I don&#039;t recall ever seeing a water temp above 90*C, and IAT&#039;s are usually 3-5* above ambient. When my water/meth comes on, drastic reduction. Overheating is a thing of the past with a v-mount.]]></description>

You got it, I&#039;m interested in finding out as well. From other owners I&#039;ve talked to, it seems like both IATs and water temps are very low, so we&#039;ll see!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Once you get this beast running I&#039;d be interested in some of your intake temps running this setup. I&#039;d been eyeing this setup for my eventual single turbo as it&#039;s the best priced V-Mount setup out there. 

Defined is fairly local to me and I&#039;ve seen some of their cars in person. They do good work and their 20B P-Ports sound awesome. I&#039;d expect no different from this setup.]]></description>
