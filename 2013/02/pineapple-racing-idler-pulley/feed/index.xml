Thanks for the heads up Kent, I&#039;ll keep an eye on it. The clearance by the water pump housing is definitely very close.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a heads up, I installed this on my FD and about 500 miles after installing I noticed the belt was wearing funny. It was actually hitting some slag on the underside of the coolant neck due to clearance issues. The guys at Pineapple did a good job with the kit, the manufacturer of the neck (presumably Mazda) didn&#039;t do a great job with the molds/cleaning up the parts. I thought I had the clearance Pineapple specified, but turned out to still run. All it took was some Dremel action and a new belt to fit perfectly. 

I read an article a while back that Goodfella posted on the forums about main bearings wearing prematurely because of an over tightened belt! Looks like you got it covered. Keep up the good work, it&#039;s coming along great.]]></description>
