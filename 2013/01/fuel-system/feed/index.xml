					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://grandmighty.github.io/grandmighty/2013/01/fuel-system/#comment-51644&quot;&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Kent, 

At first I thought you were my buddy from SoCal who is also named Kent, and one of the only people who comments on this site... lol 

I looked over all the other offerings for fuel systems and I don&#039;t think the others come close. FFE is definitely the way to go, it is the most complete and well-engineered kit imo. The rails and everything fit together uneventfully. I chose to go with 725&#039;s because I still wanted to retain a good idle, and the 725&#039;s should be similar to the stock primaries in that regard. 

And I will be going Single :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say you&#039;re doing an awesome job with this FD build. I stumbled upon your site when you were selling your wheels. 

I&#039;m just about at the same phase of my FD as you are with yours. I&#039;ve been eyeing this FFE fuel system. I think it&#039;s the best one out there right now. Anything you didn&#039;t like about it? Why the 725s over 850/1000s as your primary injectors?

I&#039;m about maxed out with the factory fuel system on my car. I run ~12lbs of boost with my twins and I&#039;ve hit 90% duty cycle. I&#039;ll be upgrading my fuel system hopefully this year.

I noticed you removed your twins in an earlier post. What&#039;s the plan? BNRs, single or sticking with OEM twins for now?]]></description>
