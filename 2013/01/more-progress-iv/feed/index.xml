I really enjoy your blog, tastefully minimalistic design (mainly the same thing I love about your cars) and the pictures are always of great quality. I&#039;m into photography myself as well actually, got a Canon 650d and a couple of really nice lenses.

Yeah, that&#039;s pretty much why I&#039;ve been thinking about installing the ignition amp too. I&#039;m not really looking for more power with any of my mods, it&#039;s just a bonus as long as the engine gets more reliable.

Here&#039;s my baby!

That&#039;s how it is right now, haven&#039;t had the time to do anything to it yet as I bought it about 3 weeks ago, just gonna enjoy it this summer, make a few minor fixes, then hopefully make some big changes to it next winter!

Which water injection kit are you thinking about going with? Been looking at the HKS and the Aquamist myself, haven&#039;t really gone into it and studied which advantages each have.

Thanks! And likewise if there&#039;s ever anything I could help with.]]></description>

Hi Nikolai, 

Great to see you&#039;ve been reading my site for a while now, thanks for that. 

I&#039;m still in the midst of this engine project so no driving reviews yet. The HKS Twin Power is supposed to help breakup and smooth things out. I got it primarily as additional security, more than anything. Pushing more power will tax the stock coil system, and this is where the ignition amp comes into play the most. It&#039;s a good thing to have period and I consider it a reliability mod, a stronger spark is never a bad thing... although you may go through plugs at a faster rate.

Having all 4 of the same plugs helps because stock, the leading and trailing were 7 and 9 pairs. Now I have 9&#039;s all around, so it makes 2 of the plugs 2 degrees colder and should help with increased power/boost. 

Water injection is planned in the future, mainly to act as a buffer and safety-net. I don&#039;t think it will be crucial to have now because I am only aiming for modest horsepower gains. 

Congrats on joining the club! Share some pictures of your new RX-7 if you get the chance. And feel free to contact me if you need any help with anything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Have you felt a difference while driving after installing the HKS ignition-unit and those new plug wires?
I ordered the same wires from Banzai a while back, and I&#039;m considering getting that ignition amplifier soon as well :)
And having the same plugs in all 4 places, how exactly will that help? Just bought myself an Rx-7 now after almost 7 years of dreaming, my dream finally came through! Been following your blogs for a while now, ever since I first came over your last Rx-7, hope you keep updating, I always check in regularly to see if you&#039;ve done something new :)
Are you planning to go for a water injection system in the future as well?]]></description>
