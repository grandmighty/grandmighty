Hi Changwoo, those RegaMasters were 17x10&quot; all around, +20 and +40. I spaced the fronts 5mm to +35.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your rx7 has very good condition. I never seen before. Can I ask you something. That wheel 17X9j +38 or +45?? let me know your regamaster&#039;s offset or specs. And I wanna know that spacer size? 5mm right?. Because I am using same caliper and going to get regamaster. But I heard about regamaster is not clear to brembo gt f50. 

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] I will be ditching the old ABS Delete setup entirely in favor for double-flared hard lines with steel fittings. The hard lines will not only clean up the routing substantially, but offers functional gains over using excessive lengths of flex lines. The brake master cylinder pictured below is from a Mazda 929 and offers a larger 1&#8243; bore, versus the stock 15/16&#8243;. The larger bore should help compensate for the increased pedal movement required to move the increased capacity of fluid in the calipers of the Brembo Big Brake Kit. [&#8230;]]]></description>

Thanks Joe. By center vanes are you referring to the actual cross-drills? Rotors with directional or &quot;curved&quot; vanes need to be installed independent of whatever direction the drilling is. Just from an aesthetics standpoint, it may seem like the rotors should be installed with the drilling sloping forward, or opposite of how I have mine installed. Some manufactures make their drillings or slots this way, in relation to the vanes. In my case, it is the other way around. 

And for the rear rotors, they&#039;re actually straight vaned so it doesn&#039;t matter what direction you install them. I just matched up their drillings to the fronts.

					<description><![CDATA[Great car beautiful attention to detail. I was looking at your Bbk install, and looking at the center vains don&#039;t you have the front rotors installed in the opposite direction? I would be interested in knowing because I just bought a used set from someone on the forums

Thanks]]></description>
